This article focuses on the discussion of what is data visualization and how it can be used most effictevly. 
The article provides a more business oriented perspective on data visualization.
I agree with their point that data visualization is crucial for determining conclusion from data.
This was discussed in class when it was mentioned as one of the two main reasons to create a data visualization(the other being displaying/organizing solution/data).
The article uses a color scheme that matches up well with its images and the website in general, making it very easy to read.
I was suprised that more than half of money spent on advertisement will be spent online.
This influx of money will make the quality of the data visualization more important.
I like how they show the reader diffrent use cases for data visualization, allowing us to have an idea on how many different fields utilize data visualization.
I don't agree with their listing of data visualization tools, as they have no perticular ranking, order, or description.
Overall I think the article does a great job on informing the reader about how data visualization can be extremely usefull in many fields, as well as the increasing demand for it.
