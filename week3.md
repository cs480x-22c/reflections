This study visualized activity in the brain using a method called electroencephalography (EEG). 
EEG measures the electrical activity on electrodes on the surface of the scalp to determine the activity of the neurons within the brain. 
It can pick up many different ranges of signals in many different areas of the brain which in turn represent different things in different activities. 
EEG is relatively inexpensive compared to other forms of measuring brain activity, thus it allows for participants of studies to have a broad range of experiences while activity is monitored.
Data is processed by the lab after being picked up from neurodes and was able to be turned from a scatter of pulses on the surface of a skull to into the implied activity on a three dimensional model of a brain.
I'm not sure if this means anything for neuroscience, it might just look pretty. 
I also don't understand what the colors mean, the center of the brain is constantly orange, while green and white bits fly around like a butterfly, and then there are sections that are just kind of blue sometimes.
It's certainly impressive that it was able to be mapped as well as it was, especially with the neat little look into the back of the brain at the end. 
However, I'm not sure what I, as someone that knows nothing about neuroscience, should be taking away from this diagram.
I guess it's one way to get likes.
