Reddit user u/HeroJournal tracked their sleep quality using an Oura ring after playing certain videogames and plotted it using an app called Bearable.
Though I don't play any of the games from this visualization, I still find it interesting that they experienced better sleep quality from playing 
videogames at all. From my own experience, playing videogames at all has a negative impact on my sleep quality (that doesn't stop me though). They
collected sleep data for 12 months with the goal of seeing what games affected their mood, anxiety levels, and migranes. The ordering of the games is
kind of surprising to me as I wouldn't think that The Witcher 3 or Bloodborne would be particularly helpful for improving sleep quality. Aside from those
two games, the order for the rest of the games makes sense as they are relatively low stress games. One thing they didn't record which would have been a
relevant statistic was how long they played the videogames each evening. If they always played for a set amount of time, then the results are valid, but
different playtimes in different games could also impact sleep quality, changing the results of the study.
