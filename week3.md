This site, *Monkeytype*, is a very simple typing test site with several different modes. The site scores how well you do on each test based on a number of metrics described in the about page, with a focus on WPM (words per minute), ACC (accuracy), Test Type (which mode you used to test), Time, Raw (WPM calculated purely based on how many words you types rather than average characters), characters (total characters typed), and Consistency (of keystroke timing).

Cool site

Tracks different attributes of typing
Very customizable themes
Small sites that builds visualizations based on user's personal data = neat, as education becomes more personalized we'll see things like this
