My visualization for this week is nothing super fancy, but I was looking around and trying to find something I was interested in. I decided to look up Taylor Swift to see if I could find any visualizations for Taylor Swift specifically, and found quite a number of Taylor Swift graphs in the below reddit post that the creator made. These graphs are pretty straight forward and easily understood and very applicable to what we just did in assignment 2 as well as what we will be doing in assignment 3, given that both involve graphs extensively. They also have the sheets file they utilized to make all of the charts. They explained how they got the data (from Spotify) and that they used the python visualization tools Seaborn and Plotly. The information of where they got the data and what they used was helpful. I did see that seaborn was another visualization possible with python and would definitely be interested in using it at some point. This data was from July 2021, so it is a bit out of date but not overly so. 

Basically, it goes through a bunch of different information. Firstly, the total spotify plays and popularity per album. Each is color coded appropriately matching the album covers as well which is a nice touch. It seems Lover, Reputation, and 1989 had the most total plays by far but in popularity Lover was highest, with reputation, folklore and evermore all close behind. Then there is a plot of the total spotify track plays per album. It varies greatly with only a couple becoming played to a super high extent. There is also the track popularity per album, which looks very different. They explain the difference between plays and popularity. The popularity is calculated by a spotify API. There are also tree diagrams for plays and popularity, color coded for each album and each song has a certain amount of space, bigger for more plays or popularity. They also have tables with the top 10 songs by plays and lowest relative numbers of plays per album. Then there are also boxplots for the acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, valence, and song duration.

I liked how the colors were consistent throughout and all of the graphs were very easily read and easily understood.
