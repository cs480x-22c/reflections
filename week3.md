- I really liked this visualization because it is very informative and visually pleasing. In essence it is 4 visualizations put together, but they are very well linked so it all feels like one diagram as you follow it down. The paths from the food groups to the continent divisions looks very cool and it works to give you a general idea of the distribution, but it's hard to estimate how much exactly. It would be cool if it were interactive and hovering over the paths gave you the percentage.  It really puts it into perspective when you can see side to side how much the average person in each part of the world consumes and comparing that to animal feed. Entire continents consume less food than we reserve for animal feed. Which is a clever way of highlighting the inefficiency of meat consumption.  The simple table showing the under/over consumption of different food types in different places is effectively conveyed by the use of logos/images and color gradients. The final part of the visualization makes the closing argument that “In 2020 there was more than enough to go around if it was evenly distributed“”. The size difference in the lined up squares clearly conveys this point. This visualization effectively utilizes the color and layout to better convey information and a strong logical argument is made as you scan the visualization.
