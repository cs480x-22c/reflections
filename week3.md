Imaging Mental Health in America

I found this visualization really intresting. The strands are used to show the percentanges. So if we look at parts that show 1 in 5 or so on, one fifth of the stands are colored. This visualization I feel eventhough is crowed displays the data very well. I also feel that it was extremely engaging to look at due to it's design. Overall I felt this was really intresting to look at. I wish this visulization was interactive. I feel that adding interactivity would make it a lot more engaging.
