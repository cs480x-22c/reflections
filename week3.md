This visualization was made by Alenka Gucke and Martina Zunica for a journal data viz challenge. This visualization shows data about asynchronous communication for one week. This paticular visualization was made in figma. 

Different colored circles represent different applications used to communicate. Each one is bundled for different communication purposes. The number of circles represent the number of interactions. This viz is interesting because you are able to see the different applications used for different communities. All data viz talk seems to take place in slackm while family chat takes place on viber. Facebook messenger is used for other purposes. I would like to see the colors match the companies more closely. Facebook messenger being orange is a bit confusing.
