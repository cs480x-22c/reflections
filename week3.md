Tier lists, originally used to rank the viability of characters in competitive video games such as Smash Bros., became popular a few years ago in YouTube videos discussing the creator's preferences among similar characters, objects, or ideas.

But after seeing this tier list of birth control methods, I now think tier lists aren't just a meme, but a useful tool for comparison.

This design succeeds at showing which birth control methods are the best, and which are not as effective.

Compared to other tier lists, this one is more effective because of the additional information within the graphic.
- For each listed birth control method, the visualization states how often the method needs to be used to be effective.
- For each tier, in addition to a star rating (out of 5), there is a graphic to show the likelihood of getting pregnant while using the birth control methods in that tier.

There are a couple ways this visualization could be improved: 
- More birth control methods
  - Only commonly used methods are shown. 
  - That being said, adding too many methods would make the visualization cluttereed and hard to use.
- Clearer communication of the chance of becoming pregnant
  - When first looking at the chart, I assumed the graphic on the right side showed the likelihood of becoming pregnant after having intercourse once. But the note for comparison to unprotected sex instead uses the annual chance of becoming pregnant. That implies that the graphic is also showing the annual chance of becoming pregnant, but the visualization doesn't explicitly state that this is the case.
