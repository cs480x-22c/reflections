This visualization is a representation of connections within the brain. The visualization on the left is from data taken from a brain on a placebo while the visualization on the right is from data taken from a brain after the patient has been injected with psilocybin. Each of the colors represents a group or region within the brain. In the picture on the left, there are many connections within regions and less that connect region to region. In the picture on the right, there are significantly more connections that go from region to region. I initially found this visualization in a book and then followed that to the source which was a lengthy article with many sciency words I did not understand. This visualization could’ve used a key because I tried reading the section of the article and only vaguely understood what they were trying to say. However, the lines and different colored dots get the point across well enough such that a key isn’t necessary to understand what the chart is trying to convey. On a high level, the viewer can see that the chart on the right is much more busy in its center almost immediately, so it succeeds there. Also, the visualization is colorful and pleasing to the eye, so it draws your attention and interest in finding out what it is talking about.

(I couldn't figure out how to get a picute of the visualization into the file. The specific visualization is the one in 6. Discussion.
