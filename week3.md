This week I found an article called “How The Best NBA Teams Juggle Their Lineups” (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-best-nba-teams-juggle-their-lineups/). This article discusses the strategy that goes into playing the best players over the duration of an NBA game. WIth so many games each season, a player is not able to play a full 48 minutes every game, so coaches use different methods for when they play their best players. Some will put their best players in at the same time and give them rest at the same time, while others will stagger their lineups and put one star in at a time. NBA Advanced Stats shows that when stars like Lebron James and Anthony Davis are not on the floor, the team’s net rating drops significantly. Therefore, James and Davis do not normally sit on the bench together, and take turns when they need a break.

The graph below shows the distribution with two stars on the Golden State Warriors, Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. The chart is split up into the quarters of a basketball game and each row is a specific game. The colors are an indicator of who is on the floor. For the Warriors, Curry and Green almost always play on the court together. This is most likely because their playing styles compliment each other, Curry is the scorer and Green does the dirty work like rebounding and feeding Curry the ball. This is a very interesting chart because it is easy to visualize and see the trends in the playing time for these two players. As you can see, both players start every game, Green will sometimes come out late in the first (I wonder if it is due to foul trouble), both of them take a break in the second quarter, and they start the third with Green coming out sometimes before the fourth, and then the fourth quarter is a little messy depending on how close the game is. I would imagine charts like this to be of value to other coaches, because they might want to play their stars when the other team has their stars out to try and have an advantage playing against weaker or more inexperienced players.
