I found this visualization on FiveThirtyEight: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-fastest-men-in-the-world-are-still-chasing-usain-bolt/. It shows men's 100m times from 1970 to 2020. As the caption states, we can see that no one has come close to beating Usain Bolt, with the second fastest runner still being about 0.1 seconds slower than him. I noticed that there are no axis labels but they're not really necessary since the chart is so simple and you can figure out what the labels would be by reading the caption. I like how they pointed out a couple of notable marks, one of them being the first sprinter to break the 10 second barrier. I think it would be interesting to add some interactivity to this chart. You could add data tips when you hover over the points to see who the runner was and what country they were from. Seeing this visualization made me wonder why there has been such an improvement in times. From 1970 to about 1985 few runners broke the 10 second barrier and after that there was an explosion. A google search revealed that better track surfaces, shoes, and advancement in training and running technique have improved over time. It may even be possible for someone to break the 9 second barrier one day.
