[Link to visualization](https://blog.ebemunk.com/a-visual-look-at-2-million-chess-games/)

I am fan of chess, and the turn-based, methodical nature of the game makes analytics very wide-spread in the community. The "Opening Tree" visualization featured in the above link is one I found particularly fascinating. It displays, in a pie chart-esque format, the most common five opening moves from a database of over two million chess games. 

While pie charts in general are not very effective at displaying information meaningfully, this one has some added features which makes it a bit more intuitive and impressive. When mousing over a particular slice, it displays a tooltip with a variety of useful information, including the percentage of games featuring the previous move it was played in. It also plays the move on the board in the center, making the chart more interactive and aiding in visualization. Another nice feature is that it displays a lighter shade of color for moves played with the white pieces and a darker shade for moved played with the black pieces. I also found the splitting of the chart into different colors based on the first move to help in digesting the data.

I think what makes the visualization effective is that the creator does everything they can to minimize the weaknesses of pie charts with these additional features. In fact, I think a pie chart might have been used by necessity and not by choice. I cannot think of another chart or data structure that could display all this information at once. It has made me reconsider my previous position that using a pie chart leads to a bad visualization by default.
