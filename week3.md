The data visualization that I have chosen for this week is a series of visualizations from the Washington Post about covid.
The first visualization is a simple line chart showing the number of cases in the US.
This is a fairly standard visualization, and contains the same information that the later visualizations expand upon.
As the viewer scrolls the view locks on a map of the US with case rates displayed on a county level, and progresses through time as the viewer continues to scroll. 
The caserate color mapping uses two colors rather than a single color to increase visual clarity.
A Timeline showing the number of cases makes the viewers progress through time, showing the volume of cases giving additional context to the map.
The next noteworthy visualization is a map of the US with the trajectory of cases visible as an angled arrow.
This shows the same information as the previous graphic, but makes the change in case numbers at a certain time explicit, rather than showing the change as the user scrolls.
This visualization also shows the case level in the color of the arrows, allowing both trajectory and case level to be shown simultaneously.
