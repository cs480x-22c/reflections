Visualization: https://www.cloudred.com/labprojects/nyctrees/#about

This visualization is an interactive model that allows the user to explore what types of trees and how many of them their are throughought 5 boroughs in NYC. The visualization is very user friendly. It shows all the types of trees on the bottom with a name and picture. When the user hovers over the tree, the percentage section will highight in all the boroughs and also create a path between the boroughs for the user to compare. 
The user can also click the tree to keep the path highlighed. Multiple trees can be clicked at once. 
the sections on the bar can also be clicked to reveal the type of tree. When the block is highlighted, it shows the name and the number of trees. On the right side of the bar the percentage is shown 

This visualization is exploratory in the the user can discover more information about the types of trees in NYC. 

I think the layered horizontal bar graph type thing works very well here because it allows the user to easlily compare the types of trees. I also enjoy the colors picked out, and how it uses opacity in a tasteful way. All in all love this visualization.
