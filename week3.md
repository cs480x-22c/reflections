This site, *Monkeytype*, is a very simple typing test site with several different modes. The site scores how well you do on each test based on a number of metrics described in the about page, with a focus on WPM (words per minute), ACC (accuracy), Test Type (which mode you used to test), Time, Raw (WPM calculated purely based on how many words you types rather than average characters), Characters (total characters typed), and Consistency (of keystroke timing). You can take a single test, or log in to a profile and take multiple tests over time with aggregated stats. Based on these stats, the site generates a very simple visualization, which gives you all the stats in an easy to consume order and plots WPM, Raw, and Errors against Time. There are also options to take the next test, repeat a test, view word history, practice words, watch a replay, or save a screenshot, and the site has multiple different customization options for theming and test taking that a user can change to their liking.

While the site's data visualization itself is relatively simple, what I think makes it so interesting is how personalized it is. As stated before, the theming and test taking options can be changed to match a user's liking, and the data visualization updates and grows to represent the user's progress as they continue to take more and more tests. Why does this matter? Because in an age where education is becoming more virtual, it is also becoming more personalized. I don't think it's a stretch to say that, in the future, we could see metrics similar in concept to *Monkeytype* take the place of current educational guidelines or standardized testing systems - metrics that aggregate and grow as students in grades K-12 study and learn on more personalized educational tracks. Having these metrics and their cooresponding personalized data visualizations to more easily track and understand a student's growth would be a major convenience to educators, would undoubtedly benefit the education of the involved students, and is something I hope we one day see implemented. 

In summary, *Monkeytype* is a really neat concept with a lot of opportunity for expansion into other systems. There are multiple fields where personalized data visualizations could/do exist, but I think the most untapped potential for this concept lies in the K-12 educations system.
