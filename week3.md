This site, *Monkeytype*, is a very simple typing test site with several different modes. The site scores how well you do on each test based on a number of metrics described in the about page, with a focus on WPM (words per minute), ACC (accuracy), Test Type (which mode you used to test), Time, Raw (WPM calculated purely based on how many words you types rather than average characters), characters (total characters typed), and Consistency (of keystroke timing). You can take a single test, or log in to a profile and take multiple tests over time with aggregated stats. Based on these stats, the site generates a very simple visualization, which gives you all the stats in an easy to consume order and plots WPM, Raw, and Errors against Time. There are also optiosn to take the next test, repeat a test, view word history, practice words, watch a replay, or save a screenshot, and the site has multiple different customization options for theming and test taking that a user can change to their liking.

Cool site

Tracks different attributes of typing
Very customizable themes
Small sites that builds visualizations based on user's personal data = neat, as education becomes more personalized we'll see things like this
