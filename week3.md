This website shows daily DDoS attacks worldwide. 

When the play button is clicked it would show the major large attacks. If we hover over one of the attacks we ould see the duration, the exact time, and date. 

There are a couple of configurations that could make this graph so useful. We could change the color of attacks by type, source port, duration, and dest port. The colors would update. So if we click at duration it would show weeks with red, hours with yellow, and minutes with green. 

Also, the size of the bandwidth corresponds with the size of the width of the line.  

If there is a big circle around a country that means it is an internal attack coming from inside that country. 

When the source is unknown we have a line going up.
