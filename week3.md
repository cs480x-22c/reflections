This visualization is my favorite out of all of the graphs I have seen. Not only is it protrayed in a creative adn intriguing way, but it also is not difficult to look at or interpret. 
I particularly like how the virus size increases by death toll. I think it is a very effective way to compare the impacts of each pandemic. I also like how after the timeline, at the bottom, 
there is a size comparison with all of the viruses next to eachother. This makes this information really easy to digest and leaves little room for misinterpretations.
