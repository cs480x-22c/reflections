<h1> Reflection 3: Gender in Star Trek </h1>

For this week's reflection, I found a visualization by data scientist Dr. Birko-Katarina Ruzicka on the popular sci-fi show Star Trek. The visual displays the percentage of lines men and women had during each episode as Star Trek's years of production went on.

Dr. Ruzicka states that her motivation for doing research into the gender ratio's in Star Trek were due to Star Trek being a favorite show of hers, and that she wanted to see how Star Trek handled the gender inequality in diaglogue (Whether or not it was equal and/or progressing towards equality).

By gathering and preparing collections of Star Trek scripts, Dr. Ruzicka used a scatterplot and mapped each episode of Star Trek with the X-axis being the year of episode airring and the Y-axis being the % of lines per episode. Each red dot is the percentage of lines women had in a given episode, and the blue being the lines of men.

<h2> Refection </h2>

Out of all the reflections I've done so far, this graph is probably the best looking while also answering the question at a glance. 
With one look at the vizualization, you can tell that in the beginning of Star Trek, men dominated the diaglogue, but as more and 
more episodes aired, women bagan getting more dialogue. By the 2000s, men and women almost shared equality in Star Trek, and by 2020,
Star Trek had just as many lines for women as they did for men.

The colors are opposite enough, and seeing as there are only two types of data points, it is very easy to see which is which. 
The X and Y axis are clear and the trendline for both men and women clearly show to increase/decrease that Dr. Ruzicka wanted
to display.

If I had to nitpick imperfections, I would probably make the decimals on the Y-axis into percentages, but that's really it.
The information in this graph perfectly encapsulate what Dr.Ruzicka was looking for when setting out to research Star Trek's 
gender equality.
