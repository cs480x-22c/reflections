The data visualization I chose for this week is the Romanian population pyramid that describes the population trends from 1959 to 2021. The first thing that came to mind when I saw this was the fact that it was so visually appealing. The colors worked very well in defining what I was looking at. For example the blue for males and the pinkish red for females with the key in the corner allowed me to almost instantly understand what I was looking at. In addition to this, the titles that compliment the bar graphs that detail exactly what historical event was happening at the time adds to the visualization experience. Through the years, I saw how the different historical events shaped the population trends of the time. For example there was a general population decrease for both World War One and World War Two. In addition to this, there was a massive population explosion after Decree 770 was put into place. After looking into what Decree 770 was, I found that abortion and contraception were forbidden for women under 40 with fewer than four children. This means that more and more children were being born.
