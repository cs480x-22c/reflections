For week three, I felt inspired by the snow to look into some snowy visualizations. I follow Mount Washington Observatory on Twitter and Facebook, and they regually publish graphs and some vis for the data they collect on the summit and combine it with historical data to make some really cool information to the public. They use their data for many research projects up at the summit and interns are up there 24/7 collecting data and taking cool pictures for the public, so if it's something you're into, check it out! They are really nice and answer livestream questions all the time on their Facebook. The viz I looked at is pictured below, which shows data collected, including wind gusts, temps, visability, wind chill, air temp over time, wind speed over time, and pressure over time. The graphs are simple and easy to follow, which I think is important when you're giving information to the public. Mount Washington has some great data and they rely on funding from the public and private research to keep going and have people live on the summit to collect it, so having visualizations that are easy to understand and peak the publics attention is important. Another cool thing is how often these are updated. This was last updated today at 8:00pm, but it updates several times of a day with fresh vizs, which is a interesting thing to consider since many of the vis we look at are past data that isn't live updated automatically.
