I think this data visualization gives a lot of information just by using different design elements, such as color, intensity, etc. An interesting feature was that the different colors of the dots were the time of day a song was listened to most. You can get a lot of information about what songs and genres people like to listen to at different times of the day. For example, you could see if there is a trend of people listening to genres like Soft Pop in the mornings versus genres like Rock in the evenings. Another thing I liked is how the visualization represented the different genres of songs. A lot of songs can usually fall under multiple genres so by allowing a dot to be placed anywhere in the circle, you can easily represent multiple genres. The use of different colors and color intensity makes the visualization very appealing and fun to look at. I think this would be useful in recommending new songs and artists to users. Spotify could make customized playlists, like they often do, based on certain times of the day or different genres. I think a good feature to add to this would be to make the visualization interactive and when you over a dot it will tell you what song it is. I also like the concept of being able to scan other people's unique charts and share and create playlists with one another.
