Week 3 Reflection- Carley Gilmore

This week's reflection, I looked at a data visualization of US Covid Cases that was listed on a Medium article in Towards Data Science as one of the top ten data visualizations of 2021. Here is the link to the blog post: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-10-best-data-visualizations-of-2021-fec4c5cf6cdb

The visualization was posted on the r/dataisbeautiful reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/k3x3o9/oc_usa_covid_cases_syringe/?utm_content=body&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_name=5f4cd7323b1e419086ff585789f8460c&utm_source=embedly&utm_term=k3x3o9
I thought this visualization was interesting because it is simple in design yet has a large impact, especially when animated. I like how the visualization was designed in d3.js, a library we have been using a lot in class. I also looked through the comments and noticed some noteworthy comments on what the visualization lacks for viewing purposes. Someone mentioned that there is no legend to indicate how big the circles are in the animated timeline. The axis is also not labeled and when the diameter of the circles representing datapoints in each month expand, they eventually cover the axis. I'm not sure if these design choices were the point of the visualization however, because I think that aspect of it increases the impact. Each circle's diameter is representative of the number of COVID cases in the US. The data comes from an ongoing Github repository from the New York Times.
