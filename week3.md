Note that the image above is actually a video on Reddit that shows how different phone manufacturers faired in the mobile phone market over time.
If you want to see the actual video click on the reddit link above. First, I thought it was awesome that the pie chart is animated and shows the
scale of mobile phone companies over time. So interesting to see Motorola and Nokia start off first and how competitors quickly caught up.
Around 2004 is when there seemed to be a lot of competition among phone companies. Of course, now the only two competitors seem to be apple and
Android. This is something that I think is becoming too common in technology is a bunch of massive tech companies. Microsoft just acquired Activision
for $68 Billion for example. It'll be interesting to see how these tech companies fair in Web 3.0 though. Overall I thought the visualization does
a great job. I don't have any cons to this visualization. I clearly conveys the phone company battle!
