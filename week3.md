I found this map from r/dataisbeautiful made by the user cwsnakes. As a first-generation college student, I found the concept of this map intriguing. 
Based on the scale of this map the highest completion rate only goes a little past 70%. 
I know that people may not complete college for several reasons, but this graph tells us that we need to have more support available for college students. 
College is a weird period where students do not have that much money and school is supposed to be the main priority. 
This makes it hard to support any family members while getting a degree, which is partly why some people do not finish college. 

I noticed that Rhode Island has the highest completion rate, and I am wondering if that is because of its size. 
There could be fewer colleges in Rhode Island so it could skew their rates to be higher than the rest of the states. 

Most people in the comments of this post were upset that the colors were not reversed to have the higher percentages be darker. However, I disagree. 
This color scheme makes more sense to me than the other way around. 
I automatically equate red to “bad” so it was clear to me that the darker the states were the lower the percentages. 
My eyes instantly go to the states with the worst completion rates, which is what I think this graph was made to do, 
as well as let people see what their state’s completion rates are. 
I may think differently than other people that see these types of maps all the time and this creator may have used bad conventions, 
but I like the way they chose to convey this information.
