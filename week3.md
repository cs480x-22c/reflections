This visualization is meant to display the popularity of the TV series Squid Games on Netflix.
Its measurement of popularity is the number (in millions) of Wikipedia daily pageviews summed over the top demographics which the author listed as English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, and Korean.
The visualization measures this trend for the last six years.
It uses an overlayed filled in line graph where each TV series is assigned a different color and their peak numbers are displayed.
It shows that Squid Games peaked at 1.54 million and the runner up, Game of Thrones, peaked at 1.21 million.
I find this graph very interesting because I like watching TV, and I have seen and enjoyed many of the TV series shows on the graph.
This visualization could be improved by adding a label and scale for the y-axis.
Future work for this visualization could also try to focus on the length of time each peaked for to show the ratio between the height and the length of the peaks.
We can see that many shows have multiple peaks which correspond with the release of a new season.
In addition, we can see that most of the shows shown on the graph were released on streaming services that offer customers the option to binge watch the entire season at once.
The ability to binge watch shows likely contributed to the higher numbers of daily pageviews, as opposed to shows which release episodes one at a time.
