The data visualization I’ve chosen this week is a lighthearted representation of the frequency of different characters in 5-letter English words. The chart has a bar representative of each letter, and the colored portions of that bar are keyed to represent proportion in the overall letter frequency of the number of times a letter appears in a word once, two, three, four and five times. If I were to change this visualization, I would make the colors more distinct and provide a more precise scale so that the differences in letter frequency can be more clearly surveyed. I would also be highly interested in a chart that visualized this for four and six letter words, and then another chart that accounts for all English words. One problem with this visualization and any language focused visualization is that language is an ever-evolving subject, and this visualization is unclear about the source used for “all five letter words”, as dictionaries and colloquialisms vary this could affect the data. I also found the frequency of the letter “n” to be surprisingly low, as a child I was taught that most words contain at least one vowel the letters n, t or s. While the use of S is frequent as expected, I found it surprising that n and t are less frequently used. Interestingly, the data seems to show that e and s are the most frequently used letters in five letter words. This data is most useful during your next hangman or wheel of fortune game!
