This webgame and accompanying visualizations help readers to better understand the concept of Gerrymandering, through doing it themselves, and being presented with their performance on different metrics relative to other readers/players. The interactive game, while not allowing exploration of data, gives a rich context for the following map of the redistricting of Austin, TX, allowing the players to understand the tradeoffs made between compactness and representation proportions for those who draw districts. 

Additionally, the game generates new data to be visualized for the user after they complete a round, showing their performance compared to all other NYTimes readers that attempted to gerrymander the map. The use of purple and yellow for party colors are good choices for a US audience, as they are quite different from our dominant parties' colors and allow the reader to think more abstractly about the redistricting problem. 

In effect, the game allows users to get a strong understanding of the Gerrymandering process by asking if a certain shaped district is compact, and challenges the user to ask the right questions to optimally Gerrymander a simplified map. As an explanatory visualization, simple games like this can have a lot of power.
