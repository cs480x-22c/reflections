I like space so I found this visualization pretty interesting. Its not to scale, and its a little confusing but it definitly paints an interesting picture. It shows (given data in 2019) every known object in our solar system with a diameter bigger than 10 kilometers. It visualizes interesting concepts like how Jupiter actually herds astroids away from planets closer to the sun than it. A lot of it is labeled and even has a size mapping, I think it is very well done.
