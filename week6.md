Week 6 Reflection- Carley Gilmore

For this week, the visualization I found was actually from stumbling across a journal article I was looking at in Technical Communication Quarterly: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10572252.2021.1906450. The article is called "Above All Made by Themselves: The Visual Rhetoric of W.E.B Du Bois'" Du Bois is remembered for his academic successes and advancement of civil rights. His  data visualizations that refute "scientific" racism date back to the late 1800s. The article talks about how ahead of his time, Du Bois was in his "modernist-before-modernism was a thing esthetic" data visualizations, Their bright colors and unfamiliar, unique representations of data denounce social Darwinism, "survival of the fittest" justifications for racism. 

The first visualization that is featured in the article shows that based on Du Bois' design choices, viewers can quickly differentiate age distributions of Black citizens in France to Black Americans in Georgia. Race dogmatists' believed that Black Americans would become extinct post-emancipation. Du Bois directly contradicts this racist belief and does so in a creative, readable manner. I really enjoyed reading this article. It inspired me to see if people recreated Du Bois' fantastic work with d3. To my delight, a few of his visualizations were recreated in observableHQ by Ben Welsh. Here is the link for these awesome visualizations: https://observablehq.com/collection/@palewire/w-e-b-du-bois. Hope you enjoy!
