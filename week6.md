This is a visualization of a worl map with shipping lanes (in red) and world flights (in white).
It shows how where the world is the most interconnected.
It shows shipping hubs and flight hubs.
Shipping is more widespread and there are shipping routes to ports on almost every shore and coastline.
There are three major flight hubs: USA (the east coast in particular), europe, and china.
Places where the map is the darkest on landmass shows areas that are the least interconnected to the rest of the world.
We can also see some small red shipping ports on islands are they appear to be in the ocean.
We can also see the curvature of the earth as the lines are curved but in reality at straight and the most direct paths.
Over the Atlantic Ocean we can see shipping lands along almost the entire length.
However, we only see flight paths over the Atlanic Ocean take up a smaller area.
