These visualizations show the number of visitors in national parks throughout the year. The angle of the circle represents the time of year and the concentric rings represent the number of visitors. Visitors are broken down by where they are staying (lodging, RV, tent, backcountry). Also, you can see the average temperature based on the background color of the circle. These graphics look really cool and are a creative way to visualize park visitors. You can quickly see how busy a given park will be at a certain time of year. One extension to this would be to open a more detailed version of a graphic if you click on it. This could have a larger gradient for temperature and the specific days of the year.
