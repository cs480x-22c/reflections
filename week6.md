Listening Together
=====
This is a visualization of spotify users who started playing the same song at the exact same time around the world. The base display is a 3D model of earth that has pins all round the globe.

The pins are color coded in which 2 pins of the same color are the locations of the users listening to the same song
![two](./images/06-2.jpg)
You can click on the pins to see what song is playing, this will play a clip of the song as well. I found this visualization  really interesting  just due to the amount of people who start listing to the same song at the exact same time.
