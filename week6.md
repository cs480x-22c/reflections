This visualization depicts a distribution of the most frequent shot locations in the NBA in select seasons from 1997 to 2020. There is a node overlayed on the background if that position is considered a "frequent" location. The data shows a clear trend away from mid-range shots and towards three-point shots. As analytics have played a bigger and bigger role in in the NBA, the three-pointer has been found to be a more efficient shot than the mid-range shot, and this graphic does a good job of displaying this.

I would have liked to see some use of color and a legend in the visualization. There is no indication as to what is considered a "frequent" shot, and since frequncy is being used as a binary value, it is import to define what it actually means. An alternate way of showing the data would be to have a heat map for each displayed season's shot chart, with a luminance scale displaying the frequency of a given location's shot. This would be defined by what percentage of the total shots taken that season were attempted from that position. I think this would paint a more complete picture of the data being displayed without making the visualization harder to understand.

The visualization is fun to explore, but it could be improved with some minor adjustments. You could even have a timeline feature that would display one chart and have it change gradually along with the season being displayed. This would allow you to fit more seasons into the visualization and make the trends in the data more intuitive to understand.
