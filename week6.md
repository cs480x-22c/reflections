This website has several data visualizations on it which seek to raise awareness of the conflict that was ongoing in Ukraine's eastern regions for several years.
The first is a map that visualizes casualties in different regions.
The map has a slider which allows the time range to be selected.
The number of casualties is communicated through the hue of the region.
The color automatically shifts to reflect the new range of casualties per region when the time frame is changed, which makes it difficult to determine changes in casualties over time with the slider.
The map is also missing other information like the borders between Ukraine and Russia, with the borders of provinces being more clear.
There is later a breakdown of the causes of death by month, using a stacked bar chart.
It is difficult to discern a clear pattern from this data presented in this way.
It also has the same category coded for in two colors, and a slider to select time ranges that is similarly useful for exploration of the data. looking at a smaller section of the same stacked bar chart does not reveal anything.
The final chart is a line chart of reported explosions, with the dates of ceasefires marked. This is a good visualization, with the marked dates of ceasefires corresponding to noticeable drops in explosions.
