I didn't choose any specific visualization from this website, but they go in depth on how several different statistics and different visualization methods for each one.
I chose this vis because it ties directly into my final project, so it'll definitely be a good reference point. One visualization in particular caught my eye though:

While the author manually circled the players with the highest WAR in this graph, it would be interesting to code my vis so that it automatically circled the top N players
in the league (shouldn't be too hard if I can just filter out the top players based on stats). Finding correlations between two stats like this would also be a good goal for 
me to have (i.e K/9 and ERA).

There was one visualization that was completely new to me, and that was a correlogram. I'm still not exactly sure how it shows the data, so I'm going to have to look into it
more. This may be an oversimplification, but it seems to just be for checking randomness in a dataset.
