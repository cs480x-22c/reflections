This is an data visualization(infographic) comparing Covid-19 with other viral diseases in human history.
It acomplishes this goal by using two different types of data visualization.
The first one is a time-based map with all diseases.
I agree with how they made the size of the pathogens relative to their respective death tolls.
I agree that they used opacity to represent which diseases were still ongoing.
I disagree with the use of their grid-box layout, since their vertical lines do not represent anything.
The second data visualization is a legend with all the diseases.
I agree with them deciding to go into more detail for the diseases with a higher death toll.
I disagree with their decision to not have a way to access more information about each disease.
A way this could be done is having a pop up when one of the smaller diseases is clicked.
Overall I think this data visualization is very versatile as it can be distributed as a physical copy with similar effectiveness as the web-based version.
