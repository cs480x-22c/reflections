The above image is a vis from r/data_is_beautiful, which tracks the world's shipping lanes and flight paths as red and white lines. The graph itself is more asthetic than it is useful - that is, the vis is more artistic than functional. However, I still thought the graph was really neat largely due to its unique look. It's also worth noting that there are locations on the graph that lack tracking lines - primarily over and near Antarctica. I'm surprised there's no shortcut over the continent for North-South shipping, though I suppose it makes sense when considering where major export locations are as well as potential volatile weather outside of extablished paths.

The one thing worth mentioning that you need to be really careful about with graphs like this is making sure the graphs are mapped properly on a non-eucledian plain. Once again, because this vis is purely asthetic, it doesn't really make a difference, but it absolutely would be important in a functional vis, such as something used for wheather (which is better plotted on a sphere anyways). I think I'd like to see an interactive version of this vis plotted on a sphere, potentially with a search function given the mass of data the vis contains.
