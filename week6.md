This visualization was taken from an article that was very political, but I wanted to use it because I thought it was such an interesting visualization. This chart represents how Americans believe others think about whiteness. The responses were split up by negative to positive remarks, and compared to responses from liberals and conservatives. All of the responses were from white Americans, one of the points of the study. The responses are represented by dots, and the dots are stacked on top of each other in order to compare the responses by quantity. In addition, each dot is colored based on whether the response was categorized by being racist, white privilege, or neither. By grouping the colors together in each stack, it is easy to visually see how many of each color are under a response and compare that to other responses. 

I really like this visualization because there is so much information being relayed, however, the viz is actually pretty straightforward to understand. I feel like the colors, orange and purple, are not really associated with anything political, and when I first saw the visualization, that was not my immediate thought. In addition, The graph includes sample quotes in order to better understand the categorization, which I think helps immensely with understanding the visualization, it does not make the graph messy or confusing at all. Overall, I think that this type of visualization is a really good way to display qualitative data because you can visualize the quantity of responses, and can also see some of the actual responses.
