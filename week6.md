This visualization shows an area based map of some of the most spoken languages in the world today. This is a particularly interesting visualization to me since despite the fact that it still shows that English is the most spoken langauge in the world, the dominance is less than expected as Mandarin Chinese is spoken almost as much.

This visualiztino has several strong representations that make it easy to look at and read. The colors group languages into areas of origin such as Indo-European and Sino, while a mouseover allows the user to view the actual number of speakers of that language in the world. My one critique of this visualization is that the color scheme seems somewhat arbitrary. A color scheme with more similar or complementing colors might go a long way in making the visualization easier to look at overall.
