This image was produced by a recet WWF report called Protecting Blue Corridors. 
The report discusses many of the reasons that whales are at risk across the world, the most lethal of which is entanglement in fishing gear. 

The data in this visualization was provided using satellite tracking data from over 845 tags from 50 researchers. 
Different colors represent different species of whale, and each has statistics on its endangerment at the bottom of the graph, as well as other stats such as the length and the population. 
The most frequently traveled direct routes are darkest, and the zones around them are highlighted transparently. 
Whale hotspots are labeled in their respective colors, including the time of year that they are active, in that location as well as the reason for them being there. 

Two things are presented as problems to me in this graph. 
First, the labels for continents and country borders are somewhat unnecessary and can be distracting from the visualization. 
Additionally, the parts of the oceans that are shallow are also indicated. 
I'm not a whale expert, so I'm not fully sure why that is. 
I feel like data on industrial fishing hotspots would be much more welcome to this graph and tell a much more powerful story.
