For this week, I found:
[Gorrce.io](https://gource.io/)

Gource visualizes a tree to animate the usage of a git project over time. It shows branches, pulls, contributors all over the history of the repository. This visualization was made by the alphablenders, a graphics programmer. This visualization caught my because if its vibrant colors and smooth animations. The graphics card allows for a new level animation framerates and lighting effects, which is what makes this project so intriguing. The node representation of the project seems to include physics as well to allow for the networks spread so that the visualization stays spread out and clean. Contributers to the project are shown hovering around and creating different nodes. The color of the nodes seem to update and change through growth. It is a very interesting way to see a codebase grow.
