 “An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton” by Shirley Wu had a variety of visualizations about Hamilton. 
This one in particular shows each song in the musical. Each bubble is a string of lyrics sung by the same person in a row. 
The size of the bubble represents the number of lines they sang in a row and the color represents who sang the lines. 
For example, Hamilton is a green color and Eliza is a light blue. I really enjoy how they used grouping to show that 
certain bubbles are correlated with each other, while also having several dimensions. You can also hover over each bubble 
to see who sang which lines in which song and what the lines were. I enjoy this visualization, being a Hamilton fan because 
it is easy to see how big each singer’s part is in each song. It is also each to tell that King George had the most solo songs 
by himself (the red dots), with Eliza being a close second. The only discrepancy I have with this visualization is that it is 
difficult to hover over the exact bubble you want because the tooltip will block your view of other bubbles, so it is almost 
impossible. However, I absolutely love this visualization and it is very well done.
