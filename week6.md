While this visulaization is very nice to look at, I feel it is a bit misleading. The use of 3D effects on the map is cool, however the specific style and map type makes it initially seem like the 
data has to do with geography, because it looks like a topographic map. Once I read a bit about it, I understood a bit more the connection between the map style and population density, which is what the 
data is actually showing. Overall, I would have picked a different style for this map, but I think it is a cool concept by showing how many people live in one area.
