This visualization represents nights spent per month in different national parks. The colored rings on the circle describe the type of shelter lived in. Green is tent, yellow is lodging, orange is backcountry, and gray is RV. The circle itself is a clock-like calendar where the bottom left is winter months, bottom right is fall months, top right is summer months, and top left is spring months. The closer to the edge of the circle is the number of nights spent by campers in the park per month. The graph also has shading inside to represent temperature with white being colder and red being warmer. This visualization could be useful for campers trying to pick their next spot to venture based on their preferred type of shelter, temperature, and number of other campers. The web page also separates each of the national parks into groups for mountain, tundra, desert, tropical, coast, and continental. I think it is well made and easy to read for the uninitiated. In the graph being used as the key, the viewer can tell that most people spend nights in a tent during the summer months when it is warmest at this park.
