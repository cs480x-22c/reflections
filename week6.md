Linked above is a web-based tool to create interactive visualizations for comparing 2D genoic contact matrices. This software 
was developed by Harvard Medical School. This tool lets a user compare massive data all at once with views and clear differentiation
variables. The poweer of this visualization is it's speed and scale. It was developed in order to more quickely be able to work through
datasets. This article ade me realize that intricacy in a visualization is not always needed. Here the software thrives on simplicity and
interactivity.
