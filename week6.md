Week six is spicy as I review the average male bodyhair around the world in this viz. It's strange, which is why I picked it. Karim Dou√Øeb is the creator of this visuzalation that shows us areas where the average male bodyhair around the world is high and low and the density via the hair texture overlay. The fact that there is no numbers or text on this makes me wonder what it all means and why there's changes in the amount of hair. Does it answer my questions? No. But it shows information in a real special way and makes me inspired by the map overlay feature and makes me want to try it out myself. The data itself comes from the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, so it is accurate and is peer reviewed. I also found information on lice, which makes me inspired about the final project to pick a topic that everyone will have itchy heads after for the next couple days. The questions I have about this viz is why they included a nipple?? What does it mean in relation to the hair? Is it for fun? I might tweet him to find out. 

EDIT: it's Nepal. It's a pun.
