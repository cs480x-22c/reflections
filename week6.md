This may be color coded, but it's just a table.

Sometimes, a table is all you need; from this table, I can easily tell that if I want my passwords to last for any reasonable amount of time before a brute-forcer can solve them, they need to be at least 10 characters long, or 11 characters if I can only use letters or numbers.

The colors are helpful; although the banding seems a little arbitrary, in general it appears that the purple and red bands are always bad, the orange band is passable for temporary passwords, and the yellow and green bands are passable and good, respectively, for passwords that won't change over a person's lifetime.
