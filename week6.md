- The visualization shows a heat map of the US representing the number of cases, through time. This visualization is great at showing how each wave of covid hits the US and how it spreads. The color choice for the heat wave is very efficient, the black and red, implicitly already indicates more deseas, while the green and blue send an implicit message of general wellness and calm. One does not need to look at the scale on the right but can intuitively understand the visualization. What I think is missing is information of what is happening at each particular time. For example, getting notified at the point that new stains develop, or when masking mandates are enforced/removed or the release of the vaccine. This would help the viewer to make inferences about why the spread is behaving as it is. Adding interactivity would allow the visualization to communicate a lot more. Being able to click on one of those black spaces that seem to randomly pop up amid a generally low case count area to find out more about what this place is and what's going on there would be very interesting. Overall a very successful visualization as it gives a good sense of how covid spreads, it does not provide detail, and remains informative in the concept sense.
