The visualization I found this week is: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/sscp5s/hours_of_daylight_per_day_throughout_the_year/

I found this super interesting because I knew that certain areas had very drastic changes in amount of daylight throughout the year, and knew it had to do with location on the earth, but I did not realize that it became the opposite on opposite poles of the earth. However, that makes sense, because the southern hemisphere does have winter in the months we typically think of as summer. I have found other visualizations for specific cities in different countries and saw how in some places, like iceland, they have only a few hours of sun in the winter, and a whole day of sun in the summer. I did not realize that places like australia mirrored that the other way, but it makes sense. I think this visualization was a little confusing at first but cool to look at. The arches were confusing with the color changes.

^^^These visualizations are also very interesting because it shows the whole year and then you are able to move along the year and see below a bar for the individual day you're stroking over. I think this is utilizing the stroke technique that we were talking about in class and it is pretty cool . Looking at this information and the information from reddit shows how the daylight is so different on opposite poles. I think the way they showed this visual was very easy to understand and the contrast of the colors made it easy to read.
