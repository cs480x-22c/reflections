I found this visualization showing the wind turbines in Europe and the second image shows wind power potential in Europe. 

Every green drop on this map portrays a wind turbine. We see a lot of wind turbines in Denmark and Germany. The wind potential in these areas is great too. 

Iceland has great wind potential but we do not see as many wind turbines.  

There are no wind turbines in Iceland even though have some great wind potential. 
This is because  "Icelandic energy firms have always had the privilege of being able to harness abundant low-cost geothermal- and hydropower options" [Source](https://askjaenergy.com/iceland-renewable-energy-sources/wind-energy-potentials/)
