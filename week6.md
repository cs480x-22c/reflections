The visualization I've chosen for this week's reflection is a distribution of the overall probability of ending up on a given monopoly space at the end of a turn. Monopoly is a classic boardgame about the wonders of capitalism and how in a few short hours it can tear your family apart. When the game begins, all players have an equal amount of money, and can move across the board freely by rolling two traditional six-sided dice. The spaces landed on represent property, which can be purchased by the first player who lands on it. Players who land on property owned by other players then have to pay them rent, which can increase if the owning player chooses to purchase houses to place on their property. As the spaces eventually all become owned by a player, the probabilities shown essentially become a player's % chance of having to pay rent on a given space. 

It's important to highlight the probabilities given are representative of the probability a player being on a certain space at their end step on their turn, which gives more insight about the 0% probability of going to jail. Although players will land on the go-to-jail space, they will never end their turn while still on the space directing them to jail, meaning there is no chance a player will land there. For similar reasons, the probability of ending your turn on spaces like the chance or treasure square are also considerably lower, as a player will often draw cards that direct them to move to another space. 

This visualization could definitely be improved by increasing the variation in color from space to space, as the heavy saturated yellows and browns are incredibly close in color and therefore add little meaning to the Author's visualization. Coupled with the fact that the numbers on each space are within a small range, this visualization leaves a little bit to be desired in terms of readability without additional information. It could be highly improved with the use of context through greater color differences, as well as a potential animation of how this probability changes throughout the game, from turn one until it reaches this randomized point shown in the visualzation. The author decided to update their visualization with a link to about fourty images that show the progression of the changing probability throughout the game, which I included a link to below for consolidation.
