For this week's reflection, I've chosen to include a visualization that I've always been passionate about, I've picked out a timeline graph indicating the future of earth, humanity, and the universe. The first thing that jumps out at me is the design, the visualization is very aesthetically pleasing and is something I would hang up on my wall. The decision to use a gradient going from light greenish blue as the universe is thriving, to a dark black as we get to the death of the universe perfectly embodies where we are in at the timeline. In addition to this, all the information that is needed to analyze the graph is perfectly laid out at the top such as what colors represent earth events, human events, and universe events, and what the size of the circles on the timeline represent being the magnitude of the event. Though there is a lot of information on this visualization, I did not feel that I did not understand any part of it and it only took me a few seconds to understand how to read it. This visualization truly surprised me with the information that it contained, for example I didn't know that in 5 million years, the Y-chromosome will have weakened to the point that it crumbles and therefore men will become extinct. The one thing I did not find was designed efficiently was the lines that extended from the circles on the timeline, they were too thin and too twisty to follow easily. This is definitely a nitpick, I thoroughly enjoyed this graph.
