Week 6 reflection
For this weeks reflection, I found a cool animation on Reddit
The visualization can be found at : https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/szsmqk/oc_the_florida_inflow_from_20152019_see/
This visualization is a map of the US and shows people moving to Florida. It shows both were people are moving from (state, not
necesarrily what area within each state) and how may people are moving. The amount of people moving is indicated by the 
darknesss of the color of the dots. The darker the dots, the more people. It is really cool to see that poeple from all over the US
are moving down to Florida. This stuck out to me because my parents also recently moved to Florida from NYC. The data from the 
inflow of people into Florida was recorded from 2015-2019. 
I like how simple the visual is. I also like how there arent any state labels. I think putting the labels would have made 
the map very messy and would take away from the point of people moving to florida. I also like the color choice for the dots
as the pale yellow into an almost brown/orange has lots of contrast and makes it clear which value is the lesser one.
