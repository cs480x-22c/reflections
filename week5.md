It feels like this visualization gives a lens into our futures as we age. Although the visualization itself is simple, the data it conveys about time spent with others is very impactful.
A few things I noticed - this data isn't the story of people's lives, but a comparison of averages between a ten year time span. The colors are bit hard to differentiate. Some comments pointed out pointed out that a sand pile chart might work better.
The main difference with a sand pile chart is that the areas are filled in underneath the graph. The y-axis being in minutes is a bit hard to read as well, but the data is interesting.
