Week 5 Reflection

Visualization: http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/

This visualization is an article from the Wall Street Journal showing how dfferent states in the US were affected by infectious diseases such as Polio, Hepatitis A, The Measles, and more. Each visualization shows all 50 states on the left, and the number of cases per year per states when hovered over the box. The color of the box correlates to how many people were infected. The color scale can be seen as the bottom of each graphic. Whats cool about the visualization is that is also shows when a vaccine for the disease was introduced and how the number of cases changed after that. 

This visualization is more expository in my opinion because is it providing the viewer with valuable information about the spread of infectious disease and how history played out. There isn't anything that I would change about the visualization. I think it is very well done and very clean. It was easy for me to read and understand which I think is the most important. I also think it is visually appealing to the eye as well. I enjoyed looking at it and understaning the general trend of data from the colors without even having to hover over the data.
