My visualization for today is a representation of the 2013 budget that was posted in the New York Times. This shows the $3.7 trillion budget in several different views, showing various spending proportionally. The use of colored bubbles makes it very easy to see which parts of the budget are largest and have increased the most in this budget. The deficit is also shown.

Another useful view compares mandatory to discretionary spending. This shows that mandatory spending significantly outpaced discretionary spending in this year, and also that discretionary spending was significantly related to the military. Various uses of color, hue, and brightness also show various characteristics of the data. The breakdown by department also shows the relative spending between various departments.
