This visualization (and accompanying blog) is significant to me because it tangentially taught me about various mapping technologies and introduced me to the Makefile. Several years ago, I was trying to build a live-updating map that displayed the continental US states plus Alaska and Hawaii. This would involve several projections, as Alaska and Hawaii are in different geographical locations, and I struggled to find an appropriate one that would reliably work. Ultimately, the steps in the blogpost didn't work for me, but I was still exposed to various map types, most notably the district-based US map. 

Interestingly enough, the district-based map was initially created in Adobe Illustrator, exported as an SVG, then converted to GeoJSON and rendered using conventional GeoJSON processes. Most of the visualizations I've looked at so far were almost exclusively built from code alone, and I hadn't really considered using digital art programs as a base for future graphics that are manipulated with data. Instead of just using art as a mockup for what will eventually be implemented with code, there are multiple ways to integrate the exact mocup itself into the final product. This is especially useful in cases like the evenly sized district map, where most of the code would just map coordinates to districts anyway. Of course, there are some downsides - for one, the resulting map isn't proportionally accurate and no projection will be able to display individual points (cities, etc) accurately. Past a certain point, it might take longer to build graphics "by hand" as well. However, I'm now exposed to a new process that could help me create better visualizations in the future.
