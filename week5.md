This visualization shows the daily routines of famous creative people. With this visualization, you are able to interact with it by toggling 
portions of their daily routines on and off. The categories used for this graph are sleep, creative work, day job, 
food/leisure, exercise, and other. I liked the category choices and I think they contain most of what happens in a day. I also like that there is a 
time scale at the top of the graph. However, I think it would make more sense for the list of people on the left to be in alphabetical order. 
That would make it easier to find a particular person. I noticed that the majority of these people spend their time eating/being leisurely and sleeping. 
This probably has to do with the time period these people were alive, but it seems like most of them had a relatively healthy work/life balance. 
It is nice to see the juxtaposition between various famous people. 
It really shows that you shouldnâ€™t compare what you do with other people because all of these famous people had different lifestyles.
