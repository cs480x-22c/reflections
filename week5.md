Week 5 Reflection
This weeks reflection I found on a tweet that was found on reddit. This was really cool tool that compares pizza places in NYC.
It can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/NewYorkPizzaRatingsAll5Boroughs/Story1?:showVizHome=no
I really enjoyed this tool. As someone who lived in NYC for 12 years, I was really excited when I found this. 
THis visual has a large plot of the different pizza places in NYC from all the boroughs. Each pizza place has a different symbol
based on which borough they are from (ie Manhattan, Queens, etc.). This graphic rates each place and then places them on a different
quadrant. 

The categories are more expensive but less tasty, more expensive and more tasty, cheaper and less tasty, and cheaper and more tasty.
Each pizza place was rated based on cost of a margherita pizza and the taste of that as well as it is probably the most
consistant slice. Each quadrant is also color coded.

This tool found the average rating to be 86.36 and the average cost to be $20.16
This tool also has options to filter the data by borough. 
You  can also click each pizza place on the chart and it highlights it. 
Overall, I really like how simple yet data packed this visualization is. As someone from NYC, it was really cool to see how different
pizza compared in different boroughs. I would have liked to see something that indicates which borrough had the best overall pizza,
cheapest pizza, tastiest pizza, etc.
