This visualization shows how many photos of cats have been uploaded per country in an archive of one million photos. All the maps and charts are interactive, so you can hover over regions to see how many photos there were for that location. I noticed that on the world map the United States is white and has no datatip when you hover over it. I wonder if this is a mistake since the pie chart below shows the United States as having the most cat photos. I also noticed that the pie chart looks kind of distorted for the smaller slices. I'm not sure if this is an error or a design technique. One more thing is that the scales between the maps are not consistent, so you can't really compare directly between maps, they are standalone. A questions I have about this data based on these visualizations is if countries with a smaller number of cats actually have fewer cats or is it just a lack of internet access. I also wondered why the author chose to highlight certain countries, such as Italy and Germany. I was initially thinking that it is because these countries have more cat photos and they wanted to explore that data further, but it appears that some countries like Austria didn't have many cats and are higlighted anyways.
