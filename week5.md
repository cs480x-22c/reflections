This visualization is interesting to me and is from an article that discusses why Black women are missing from conversations about police violence. The visualization is a timeline where columns are 60 days of time. Each column is filled with a color and represents the number of articles written about a Black woman who was fatally shot by the police. On this graph, some of the columns are labeled with the person who the article was written about, but then there are other columns that are shaded and have no label. I do not have a ton of knowledge in this topic and am left to wonder if the people who are labeled on the graph are more well-known. It almost leads me to think that some of these shootings are worse than others or that one person was more important than another. This visualization has me left with a lot of questions. I am also confused with the legend, which has an axis where the labels are not evenly spaced out. The author may have done this to visually show the significance that there are not many articles written, but also the colors have a smaller space in the legend and it actually makes it harder to compare with the other colors on the graph.  Additionally, there is a caption that states that “half of the Black women who have been fatally shot by police in 2015 have gotten some national media coverage, but in most cases the coverage is limited”. But, the graph itself does not have any numbers on it so it is difficult to believe the statement, or even prove it with the data given. I cannot confirm the 50% receiving media coverage and think it would be nice to see a list of all of the names of people who the articles are written about. If this would make the graph clunky, I almost believe that it would look better off of the middle of the chart and instead have a mini case study on the side of the graph. Something that I do like about this visualization is that at the bottom, it explains how the data was collected and what keywords were used in the search for these articles. Therefore, someone else who wanted to double check on the data could verify it.
Another graph that further proves one of the points that the designer of the first graph was aiming to do, is a graph that compares the number of articles written about Goere Floyd and the amount of articles written about Brianna Taylor. I think this graph is a little easier to understand because it is straightforward, but also because it only focuses on two people and those 2 people have been in the news recently.
