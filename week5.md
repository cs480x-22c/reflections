This data visualization was found on r/dataisbeautiful. It shows the flights over Madrid on Feb 1, 2022.

I really like the way this data visualization conveys temporal data. By animating it over 60 seconds? It’s possible to visualize a day of travel paths, see the history of that day, as well as identify patterns of peak/low air traffic.

The map is also well labeled, as it contains a title, sources, and author. I think the color palette is also good, but I’m unsure if it’s color safe. 

A couple things are missing if we interpret this visualization strictly as a map as well. All maps should have a scale and a north pointing arrow.

If I were designing this from a more artistic perspective, I would probably decrease opacity outside of Spain, or use shadows to “elevate” Spain and make the other countries not as important.
