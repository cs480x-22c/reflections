The website is made to show how governments are ranked with one another. 
This is done through the representation of a governments characteristics in a "DNA" format.
I agree with their color usage, as everything was easy to read.
I also agree with how interactive the map is.
Almost everything can be clicked to get a better data representation for the item that is selected.
I agree with their use of opacity to represent ranking.
The usage of opacity makes it so a user does not have to select on a particular item to get an undertanding of its' general ranking.
I agree with them allowing the user to view the data in multiple(4) different charts. 
I disagree with the design decision to not include a search bar for if a user wants to look for a specific country.
The quantity of countries makes it difficult to look for a specific one.
Overall I think this data visualization uses good colors and is very effective, but is missing some small features that would greatly increase its' effectiveness.
