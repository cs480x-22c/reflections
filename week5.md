For this week's reflection I decided to choose another data visualization about the COVID19 pandemic. This one specifically depicts the riskiest activities in terms of contracting the virus. Right of the bat, the thing that stands out the most is the color coordination. The decision to go from yellow being lowest risk, to red being the highest risk, I feel is a very well done artistic choice. Even though there are low risks, on the chart, the usage of yellow indicates that they are still risks. If it were green as the lowest risks to red as the highest risks, people who would see this chart would believe that perhaps the lowest risks are not risks at all. The decision to use red for the highest risks speaks for itself, these circles pop out at you as things definitely not to do. In addition to this, I like the fact that the visualization splits it up into 3 categories with lines in between. There are the low risk, medium risk, and high risk bubbles. If they were all just mixed together or even without the lines, the visualization would not be as easy to interpret. One thing I think could have been worked on with this graph is the distinction between the different sizes of the bubbles. I can see that the bubbles in the low risk category are smaller than those in the high risk category but I found it difficult to understand why. If it's because of the severity of risk, the color is already depicting that and now there are two variables, both color and size, that explain how risky an activity is. This is effectively redundant.
