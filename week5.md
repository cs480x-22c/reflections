This visualization shows the Debt-to GDP ratio. 

I think this is a cool way to visualize the how dept compares from nation to nation. 

The first circle starts with Panama at 62% Debt to GDP ratio and ends with Pakistan at 82%. 

The United States is in the 3rd circle at 133%. The data is recent February 2022. So I don't think much has changed since then.  There are a lot of first-world countries with high levels of Debt to GDP ratio. US economy is strong and I don't the current Debt to GDP ratio will have a big impact.

I think is important to pay attention to what debt could do. Greece is at 207%. Greece's economy has never been the same since the debt crisis.

I think the colors give this graph a better understanding going from white to red as we get closer to the circle.
