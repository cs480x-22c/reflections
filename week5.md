This visualization was created by Reddit user u/desfirsit and they analyzed a file containing over 350,000 English words, determining what
the most common ways to start a word were. They did this to four letters in each word and recorded how many words started with that 
selection of letters (the number in parenthesis). Though it is the most common letter, E wasn't even close to the most used letter at 
the start of a word (unsurprising considering it's a vowel). 

One thing I noticed about the visualization that they didn't elaborate on was the difference in branch widths. They definitely changed for
each letter, but the width didn't seem to correspond to the frequency of the letter combination. It would also be interesting to see a smaller 
dataset (i.e just the words in the Oxford dictionary, or non-obsolete words) as it seemed like some of the words weren't actually words (for
example, ZZZ was at the end of the list). A lot of words are also obsolete, so an analysis of more relevant words would be nice.

I did a quick search and Princeton has a word database at [https://wordnet.princeton.edu](https://wordnet.princeton.edu), so it would be 
cool to see if you could somehow link it to a webpage for analysis.
