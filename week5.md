This is an interactive visulization of a love story between two bikers. The visulization uses maps to show the distance they couple travel when they first stared dating and when they traveld around the world till their eventual engagement location. I thought it was really creative and engaging way to visulize their story. I feel like if this story was a normal blog post it would be boring. But with the added visulizations it evolves the whole story.
