This visualization shows a map of the Netherlands under a sped-up 24-hour time lapse.
It uses dots to represent trains that are on-duty.
Intercity trains are blue dots and regional trains are green dots.
The dots move around the map as time progresses.
In the early morning there are not many trains out.
Slowly and then all at once many more trains appear.
We can see highly frequented train routes which have many trains traveling the same path.
There are many trains overall and slightly more green regional trains than intercity trains.
There are also many train routes that intersect and reach throughout the various areas of the Netherlands.
Towards the end of the day heading into the night, the number of trains on-duty declines drastically.
The trains that are still running at this time of night are around 5 intercity trains and no regional trains. 
I found this visualization very interesting because, in America we do not have the best public transportation system(s) and this map seems to show a comprehensive public transit system in the Netherlands.
