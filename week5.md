This week I found a visualization about wordle on DataIsBeautiful Reddit and thought it was super interesting. My roommates have been playing and I just started and now that I have and understand how wordle works, this graph was cool to read. Basically it goes through every letter of the alphabet and orders them by which are the most frequent (dark blue being most frequent to light greenish for least frequent), and has the percent for how frequent each one is. Then,  next to each letter there is a histogram or bargraph? Of the frequency of each letter in each position of the 5 letters. I think it's aesthetically fairly easily to understand and has interesting data. All of it is in large letters so that it is accessible and easy to read, although the only possible complaint could be that the light green yellow is very light and therefore a little bit challenging to read. Looking at the letters, it generally is what I would have guessed. Vowels are all very frequent, as well as R, T, L, S, N, and C. I would have expected M to be a little bit more frequent than it was. Some of the more rare letters were not even found in every spot, which makes sense but I didn't think about it (There's no 5th spot v, last two spots of Q, or last spot of J. I did not expect X or Q to be more common than J.
