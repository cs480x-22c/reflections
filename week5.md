The visualization I am looking at this week are word clouds pertaining to Magic: The Gathering cards. The three visualizations are for words in the names of cards, words in the card types of cards, and words in the textbox of cards. For the name of cards cloud, it seems like the most common words in names are creature types. Words like ‘Goblin’, ‘Dragon’, and ‘Elemental’ are among the most used words in card names. The word cloud on card types uses the entire type instead of singular words because there are only 8 supertypes in magic that would easily outshine the more diverse set of subtypes. The biggest type combination in the middle is ‘Creature Human’ which I wouldn’t necessarily expect. The next biggest types are combinations of the supertypes or supertypes that mainly have one specific subtype like ‘Artifact Creature’ or ‘Enchantment Aura.’ The final word cloud describes the frequency that certain phrases appear on cards. Unlike the name word cloud where there are many that are around the same size or the type word cloud where there is one big phrase and many smaller ones, the text word cloud has a few very large phrases and a bunch that are slightly smaller. It is not hard to draw the important values of the game from this word cloud. ‘target creature’ appears to be one of the largest on screen showing that using cards that affect specific creatures is very common. ‘enters the battlefield’ is the other largest phrase and shows that cards having an immediate effect when played is a usual occurrence.
