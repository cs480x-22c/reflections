I thought this visualization was interesting for its demographics. I'm always interested in which regions of the world are the most "social".
Overall I thought the color coding of the different quantities was effective although it confused me at first. It's interesting how I assumed the
color red meant regions with more Facebook users per 100,000 inhabitants. I had initially thought Russia and China had way more Facebook users than the Americas.
After reading the key in the top right however I realized it was the exact opposite. I guess it makes sense given how huge Russia is. In fact, could this graph
be misleading? Because perhaps Russia does have more Facebook users than other regions of the world. It's just that their people are spread out much more making
the Facebook users less "dense". I wonder if it could also be because Russia and China have a little more control over app usage and such. For example, China banned
Tiktok. They also banned Video Games for kids under 18 to play during the week.
