The visualization I've chosen for this week's reflection is a representation of relative wealth inequality of a given country compared to income inequality, meaning the disparity between the earnings of the wealthiest and poorest in a given country. Income inequality was measured using the Gini (2019) coefficient from the world bank, while wealth inequality is represented using the Wealth Databook 2018 by Credit Suisse. This visualization was created using ggplot2, which I thought was unique as most of the subreddit consists of excel graphs and other tools to create animated graphs. This was attached to some extremely informative statistical information about the signiigance and history Gini index. 

This visualization does an excellent job of consolidating an overwhelming amount of information that's bogged down with tons of mathematical jargon. Wealth inequality from nation to nation is a concept that most are globally aware of, but the visualization helps to give context to the inflated numbers reported for income and GDP across different countries. Mostly, this visualization simplifies the implication of the gini index without having to view a multitude of line plots. For context, the Gini index is calculated as the ratio of the area between the 'perfect equality line' and the Lorenz curve (A) divided by the total area under the perfect equality line (A + B). The perfect eqaulity line is a calculated ideal based on the value of labor, while a Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of income or wealth within a population. Lorenz curves show percentiles of the population against cumulative income of all those falling below that percentile. The level of unequal distribution increases when the Lorenz curve drifts away from the baseline, leading to a higher Gini value. While these can be understood by viewing the line plots generated using the Gini index, the bubble chart shown makes the information much more digestable

I also found the various different colors used to represent continents to be helpful in identifying countries I'm less familiar with. I would improve this visualization by adding more degrees of accuracy to the X axis, 'enlarging it', to more easily view the size difference between different countries' datapoints.
