This is a data-visualization of Earths Subarine Fiber Optic Cable Network. The visualization was created in R and used the
rayrender package. Data was converted using geojsonsf to sf package and the imported into the 3D rayrender library scene. 

This visualization was interesting to me because it has value different from most visualizations. In past reflections and lectures
we have seen a lot of different viz's where color, size, amount of quality data, etc were all major factors in the viz's value. Here 
the colors mean nothing other than to differentiate the lines. Similarily the line weight has no value other than to allow everythig to 
seen. Here the value comes from the 3D render showing the intricate data from around the globe. This example has changed how I view making
my own visualizations and made me rethink my own process in getting the message across through data.
