For week five, I saw on my reddit a post about Wordle's letter frequency compared to Scrabble. I am absolutely awful at Scrabble, but I enjoy playing it against my second grade cousin because it's the only time I win. As someone who plays both, this graphic did not surprise me since everyone knows the vowels and s’s are always most common and worth the least amount in scrabble. I think that now that the New York Times has taken over the application, I would be interested in seeing if this letter frequency changes at all since the Times is known for some head scratcher words with z’s, q’s, and other wild-card letters. I would also be interested in seeing the overlap between legal words in both games and if that had a change in the letter frequency, since cheaters like to see what is legally in scrabble to solve the Wordle. Overall, I like this graphic but it would be great to have a hover for details tool for the letters that are on top of one another, since it can be a pain to see them (and likely impossible for anyone with color blindness)
