- The visualization shows the most common passwords used, the text size reflects the frequency the password is used. Passwords are also color corded by category, which makes it more visually appealing but I don't feel like the categories add anything. It is amusing to see the type of passwords most used. If you hover over a word it tells you the rank value of the password. This rank means nothing to the viewer as they can already see the size scale, it would be much more useful to show the number of times this password was found or the percentage of times it was used.The data from the graph was obtained by data breaches. There is also an accompanying graph of the data breaches where the data was obtained. That visualization shows a bubble graph of data breached on a timeline. Both visualizations are simple and to the point.
