Above is a visualization of the biathlon positions over time in the Winter Olympics.

This visualization uses d3, and a full version of it is available at the following link:

The viz doesn't have an explicit key or legend, but it's labeled throughout so to avoid confusion, which makes it look very professional. 

Only people who were at a point in a medalist's position are shown in the visualization.

It visualizes the positions over time during the biathlon. Skiing segments are shown in grey, while shooting segments inbetween are not. The points on the timeline when the person is in the gold medalist position are shown in gold.

Also visualized are the number of missed shots during the shooting segments, as well as the lowest position someone holds as well as their finishing position.

This is really helpful for visualizing position data! It seems like something to show performance out of a video game. I do wish it was animated or interactive in some way, such that I could watch the video of the performance with the timeline moving along across the chart.
