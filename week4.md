For this week's data visualization I chose a diagram that showed the relationship of letters in the English alphabet. It connects letters that frequently follow each other in words. This was done by analyzing 370,000 different english words and breaking the down into letter pairs. Then for each letter the two most common pairings were then taken out. Based on this diagram, the letter A is followed by the letters T and L equally at 14% of the time. Also the letter Y was at the end of the word 52% of the time that Y was seen in the list of words. I really enjoyed this diagram because recently I had picked up the very popular word game called Wordle that makes you guess the daily word of the day. This diagram allowed me to a better guesser and understand what letters have strong relationships. In addition to this, the diagram is just very visually appealing. The color scheme makes the diagram very easy to see and it's just spread out enough to not waste any space while being able to see where all the arrows point to without any trouble. This was a diagram where a title wasn't needed and you could tell exactly what was going on even without the need for a title.
