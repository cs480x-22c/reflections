My week 4 reflection is on the Tabula Peutingeriana, a medieval map of roman roads on a 22ft long scroll.
This is a somewhat unique choice but I believe it to still be a data visualization.
The main data visualized was which cities are connected and how many days travel are in between them.
A road connecting cities is represented by a red line, and each day's travel is visualized by a hook on the line connecting them.
Given this the map was clearly meant to aid in travel planning, but with exclusive usage of roads depicted on the map, as the path of the road and the relative locations of cities are completely lost in this map.
The most notable attribute of this map is that it is projected onto a 22ft long scroll, completely distorting the geography but preserving the relevant information.
Although the continents can still be determined, and the shape of Italy is relatively preserved, doing anything beyond identifying them is impossible.
The benefits of this projection is that the user can explore only a section of the map where they plan to travel without needing to see unnecessary locations.
Similarly this map does not dilute the travel time with information "unnecessary" in this context, like geographical location or total road distance.
Although strange looking this scroll is a very efficient way to communicate the relevant information for a classic road trip, without extraneous information, and overcoming the limitations of the medium it was written on.
Lessons can be learned from this bit of ancient data visualization as for how to strip away unnecessary data and meet the constraints imposed by how the user will view the visualization.
