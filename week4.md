After Tamir Rice’s death, the city of Cleveland has paid more money in police misconduct settlements than in the five years before Rice was killed. This data could mean multiple things, for example if police misconduct has gotten worse or if Charleston has started to take police misconduct more seriously. However, this is just compensation and it is still rare for police officers to face criminal prosecution. Because of this, it is hard to tell if change is actually occurring in the city. And, it is difficult to compare police misconduct across cities due to the different ways that cities organize and characterize their settlements. The visualization below is an example of why it is difficult to compare. In this chart, Charleston settlements are being compared to Cincinnati settlements. The green color for both cities represents the settlements that were filed under civil rights. When taking a quick look at this graph, it seems like Cincinnati has more civil rights settlements. However, when looking more closely at the graph, Charleston has a lot more categories than Cincinnati which could be why more settlements are categorized into the civil rights section. 

  	I really like this visualization because it actually explains how the graph might be misleading on the graph itself. The blurb in the middle of the chart explains a lot and makes the graph understandable. Iit easily makes sense why the graph might be misleading. However, I am not the biggest fan of the color scheme. Blue and red are usually political colors and I wonder if that was done for a reason which would be interesting. If not, I wish there was another color used. Also, I do not understand the gradient. Are the darker colors typically “worse”crimes? Is there a scale when it comes to the type of settlement? I feel like it might be difficult to determine the severity of a crime or type of settlement. Overall, I think it is very cool, and have never seen a graph that explains why it is misleading; it actually makes me trust the author more.
