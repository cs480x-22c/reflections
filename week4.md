For week four, I tapped into my Animal Crossing obsession and looked at some data related to the game. I think game visualizations are cool in the sense that the game itself is a programed algorithm so in theory we should know what these charts and vis would look like. But for most players, they are not diving into the technical side of games or code mining to find these stats, so these events just seem truly random. I think that there's a great niche for players to learn about the game itself through these visualizations because they are so straightforward and I've seen them done for games like Minecraft, which also get good traction. It's interesting that they choose the disliked pie chart, but I think it works pretty well since it's balloon shaped and just for fun anyways. My only change would be removing the yellow on blue text because it's awful to look at.
