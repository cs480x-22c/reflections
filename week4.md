Week 4 Reflction 

Visualization: https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/best-in-show-whats-the-top-data-dog/

I really enjoy this visualization. Its very simple with no interactive componenets but gets the job done well. Based on six criteria (intelligence, cost, longevity, grooming, ailments, and appetites) the dogs were placed into one of the four following categories, Inexplicably Overrated, Hot Dogs!, The Rightly Ignored, and Overlooked treasures. Within each category, there is a solid image of the dog and the dog is either facing left or right. The size of the dog represents the actual size of the dog, the color represents the type of dog (ie. sporting, working, hound, etc), and the direction the dog is facing tels whether the dog is dumb or clever. 
It also shows the dog on a scale of how poplular they are (y axis) and how the dog ranks on their data score (x axis). 
This visualization is more exploratory than expository in my opinion because viewing this visualization provides me with new and fun information that I enjoy learning. 
I really enjoyed the simplicity of the visualization. It goes back to the basics by using size, color, and direction, but its still looks great and is very aestheticaly pleasing.
