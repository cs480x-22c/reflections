This is another one of my favorite visualizations by far. I personally find it difficult to truly understand the size of large datasets, and this visualization really gave me a sense of 
how large the distances were. I also like how the design is very similar to actually being underwater, as it portrays the ocean depth very well. The images that describe depth points
really top off the whole look and tie the whole thing together. I think this visualization very successfully protrays the information it is trying to explain.
