<h1> Reflection 4: High School Sports Injuries </h1>

For this week's reflection, I asked my brother in high school if he's seen any interesting graphs and he sent me this article in the New York Times that they went over in his physical education class.

The New York Times article goes over the various injuries in different locations that high school students get playing different sports. This information was gathered by Dr. R.Dawn Comstock and the sports injuries researchers at the University of Colorado Denver; information that included fourteen years of data on high school sports.

The visual itself is very interesting, as it uses a human body to map the amount of injuries there have been on a specific body part per 10000 games. There are 6 of these human graphs, one per each sport listed on the graph. For example, in the Hockey graph, the number of head injuries per 10000 competition plays is 18.

<h2> Reflection </h2>

The graph itself is pretty self-explanitory, as it maps the size of each bubble to the amount of injuries a body part sustains, showing that some body parts get injured more than parts and in different sports. The body maps are also in decending order by how many injuries there are, so it is pretty easy to look at the map and say "High school students that play Football get more injured than any other sport" or "Basketball is the safest sport by number of injuries."

While the graph does display the basic information well, it seems pretty empty to look at. I feel like providing some extra statistics under the graph would make it feel more complete, like average head injuries in a given sport. They are also very broad with what kind of injuries are displayed. Take the hand injuries on the football graph; the bubble is more put over the wrist area than the hand, which got me thinking "Do wrist injuries and hand injuries count as a general hand injury? What about just fingers?" When it comes to sports, I feel like what kind of injury someone sustains is more specific that just a "hand area." The leg parts of the graph make up for this a bit, but I feel as if only having knee and leg bubbles on one half of the body might make it seem like its only that size of the body rather than both.

Anyways, for conveying the basic information of high school sports injuries, the graph does pretty well with a clever and interesting map/graph.
