This tree diagram shows the hierarchy of ownership among video game publishers/studios.

Because the visualization takes the form of an 8071x8292 image and the elements aren't small, it is nearly impossible to explore effectively in Chrome. In particular, it is either too zoomed out to see anything, or zoomed in so far that not all of a branch fits within view. The best solution to this problem is to use an interactive Web page, but an alternative is to just shrink the image.

The visualization also isn't complete. A particularly notable exclusion is Valve (creator of the Portal and Half-life games, and of the Steam platform), but there are other video game studios that aren't on the visualization, such as Traveller's Tales (a subsidiary of Warner Brothers that is responsible for the Lego games).
It would make sense to exclude these companies if the visualization is meant only to include video game companies that are owned by other video game companies, but even so, Valve is important enough that I think it should be included regardless.
Independent companies like Valve could be incorporated by adding a sidebar with the logos of independent companies.

The original file (https://i.redd.it/3ewqptyuegk81.png) is too big to include in a .md file, so the image below is a smaller preview.
