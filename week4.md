I found this interesting data visualization of US recorded music revenues by format on r/dataisbeautiful. The data visualization show revenues for different music media over time. Initially, vinyl and cassettes, all the way to today with streaming. The visualization goes from 1975 to today. 

I think it's fascinating to see the progress over time. We went from all physical mediums to streaming dominating the scene. Even more surprising, today, vinyl is the second-best format for revenues after streaming. The first is streaming with $9bn, and the second is vinyl with $0.63bn. Even more surprising is that CDs and downloads amount only for 0.4 and 0.6 billion dollars respectively. I find it fascinating that vinyl was getting lost, but it had a great comeback.

I think the plot is also very well done. The sources are items, the color palette is accessible, and the fonts are overall well done. I don't particularly appreciate that the background is black. I think it makes it less appealing from a visual perspective. Also, it takes about 1 minute to watch, which can be a bit too much for a general audience not interested in month-by-month changes. I think speeding it up could be nice, and it would avoid making busy people skip around the plot. 

Overall, I really liked this visualization; it's simple but powerful!
