Visualization: https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-hollywood-insider/

This visualization displays every major film from 2008-2016 and their stats ranging from critics review, how much money spent on it, and how much money recovered. 

The bubbles are placed on a graph with the x-axis initially being critics % and the y-axis being %budget recovered. There are also ticks on the y axis and the x-axis showing how successful the movie was and movies worth watching, respectfully. The axis can also be changed through a drop down menu to any of the stats listed. 

The color of the bubble represents the genre of the movie and the size of the bubble represents the budget of the movie. Hovering over the bubble shows all the stats for that movie and clicking the bubble brings you to an amazon page for the movie so you can purchase it. 

I would consider this visualization exploratory because it allows the user to discover new movies. I like the visualization but I almost think there is took much information there. It took me a little longer than I think it should've to understand what was happening. There are just so many options on how to look at the data given which is great but also overwhelming. If I had a chance to fix something I might make the scope of the visualization a bit smaller.
