I found the following visualization on dataisbeautiful: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/q4dc8b/oc_the_pandemic_in_the_us_in_60_seconds/. It shows the spread of COVID in the US between February 2020 and October 2021. I think the color scale makes sense, I would associate red and black with a higher number of cases. I can see trends in this visualization that match up with what I remember from the news at the time. Earlier on it seems that cases began around California and New York, while later we see that there are more cases in the South. I think it would be helpful to give this map a slider so you can explore the data on your own (although you can kind of use the video slider for this). It would be interesting to see this type of visualiztion for other countries and to show other COVID related statistics, such as deaths and vaccinations. Having different statistics in parallel could help show the relationship between these things. For example, I would expect as the amount of vaccinations go up on one map, the cases and deaths would go down on another.
