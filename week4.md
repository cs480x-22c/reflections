This week, I decided to use the program Chimera that I have downloaded from Bioinformatics classes. I had forgotten that those models in the program would count as visualizations. Basically, in chimera, it uses an extension of python to create specific models of different proteins that you are able to move around in a 3D format and change the style of. There is a multitude of things you can do with Chimera and its super cool. You are able to change the color to make it more distinct / exciting, you are able to add multiple proteins at a time. The style of protein, which automatically comes up as ribbons can be changed to other types, such as ball and stick. There are also ways to align different proteins and match up the similarities. This resource is super helpful for Bioinformatics work and while can be a bit confusing to try to work with, has a lot of tools and abilities that make it worthwhile. For this week, I have a picture of one of the proteins attached but will showcase how it moves elsewhere. Similar protein modeling can be seen elsewhere, including on the PDB where they show protein models. Chimera actually gets its data from the PDBs to show the 3D models. The PDB has the model of the proteins in a database (Protein Database).
