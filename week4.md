- I found this visualization very interesting. I was particularly impressed by how it gives such a good impression of scale. Superimposing reference magnitudes such as Florida and Manhattan, means perhaps more to the viewer than just a number; this is a creative and effective choice. The visualization includes all relevant markers: everest, mariana trench, the habitable layer for humans, satellites and commercial space flights. Each marker represented simply, clearly and aesthetically. The background that shows the earth and darkening sky looks both realistic (the clouds are a nice touch) yet still maintains the simplicity of a drawing or graphic. This I think was a very good choice, it looks aesthetic yet plain enough that it doesn't distract from the information, it just draws the viewer in.
