This article was posted after the retirment of Tom Brady, an American Football Player.
The article begins with briefly describing that the purpose of the article is to compare his achievements with other players at his position.
I agree with the fact that they have an informal legend when they explain what the highlighted lines mean(active players).
I think this makes the article more inclusive to people who might not be too familiar with American Football.
Another thing I agree with is that they kept the colors simple.
The compare and contrast of grey and blue is easy to see, and they dont stuff the data visualization with an unnecessary complex rgb color scale.
I dont agree with their design choice to make it so a user can select a line.
I think it is far to diffucult to select a line and see the players name.
To fix this I would either make the lines thicker or remove the feature so it does not take away the users attention from their player search bar(which works well).
Overall I like how this article lets you compare Brady's accomplishments in many different ways, while also being able to see some trends in the NFL.
I would say this is the best data visualization I have reflected on so far.
