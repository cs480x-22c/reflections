This visualization is showing earthquakes and their magnitude from January 2021 - January 2022. I think this visualization is very eye catching because it uses a globe to display the data rather than a flat map and it uses a black background light colors to create the illusion that the dots are glowing. I think that the interactive map is good so a user can focus on a specific location if they need to. Another eye catching feature is that they made the globe transparent so you can see earthquakes on the opposite side of the Earth than what you are looking at.

While this visualization is very interesting to look at there are many disadvantages to this and some changes I would make. Although it is a nice feature that the globe is transparent, it does make the visualization more confusing to look at because you don't know if a dot you are looking at is on the closer side or opposite side of the globe. I would decrease the opacity of the globe so you can tell the location easier, but it still has that transparent effect. Another disadvantage is the continents are very hard to see because they are pretty dark so you can't tell where an earthquake is on the graph. I would lighten the colors of continents so they are more recognizable and I would add some major cities or borders of countries to better indicate where the earthquakes happened. Another change I would make is the legend is a bit vague because the intervals are only 4, 6, 8 and many magnitudes of earthquakes are determined to the first decimal so I would add more numbers to the legend to be more specific. Lastly, the interactive graph is great because when you click and drag the globe it doesn't move smoothing so I would definitely improve that to make it move smoothly.
