I will be reflecting on the below article, the others are attached as I also found them interesting

https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot

This is an article detailing the open source js lib Observable Plot, and while that is basic at its core
the article is a really cool jumping off point for all things tabular data. 

Manny of the hyperlinks elaborate in more detail the over arching ideas behind the library. The Plot Cheatsheets PDF is especially helpful. 

The part of this article that I found most interesting was the logical decisions made when attempting to increase the value the visualizations are bringing.
It is the first time I have come across the idea of binning in viz. Additionally, the empohasis on readability throughout the graphs iterations is exactly the
thought process that I feel like I personally need to come to understand. 


This visualization isnt that impressive, but for some reason the articles thought process was the first time the viz developement process started to really click.
