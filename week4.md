This image was created in Julia using a package called Algebra of Graphics, which was heavily inspired by R's ggplot2. 

This graph includes the scatterplot of three different sets of data, all of which measured for the length and depth of their bill.

The three in question are Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. 

In the graph, this new function is able to take the individual groups in the scatterplots, and then combine them such that each species has its own trendline.

In addition to being clustered together and the trendline showing where they are near, there is also an effect extending from the trendline to show the uncertainty of the data on the trendline as it progresses.

Lastly, the clusters of data allow for a topographic representation of the data throughout the trendline. 

This allowes you to easily point to the average length and depth of a penguin bill of a certain species.

The colors used for this, blue, yellow, and green, don't seem to cause problems with red-green color blindness, and the graph itself appears very easy and accessible to look at while conveying a lot of data.
