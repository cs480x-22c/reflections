This visualization is a scatter plot of the average weight and height per sport of summer and winter Olympic athletes from 1992 - 2016. 
It color codes between summer and winter sports.
The larger the dot, the higher the variance is between the weight and height of athletes in the same sport.
I find this visualization very interesting. 
Based on the average weight to height ratio for each sport we can see how those individualsâ€™ bodies would be best suited for their respective sports as each sport uses different combinations of muscles groups.
We can also see a different in the pattern between summer and winter sports.
Summer sports have more variation of the weight-height ratio with sports along both ends and the middle. 
On the other hand, the majority of winter sports fall near the center of the graph. 
This means that on average, winter athletes are shorted than the tallest summer athletes, taller than the shortest summer athletes, and fall in the middle of the mean weights.
I also find it interesting that perhaps the largest dot (with the most variance) is basketball which is on the higher end of mean weight and height. 
As a team sport, it would make sense for there to be more variance as different team members have different roles/positions on the team and as such may have different body types best suited to their positions.
