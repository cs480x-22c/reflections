The visualization I've selected this week is a color coded chart representing the rate of birth via Cesarean section across the European Union and the United States. The author created this visualization in MS office, which I found interesting as I've never used MS office to create a visualization and wouldn't think to use those tools to create this type of visualization. It's worth noting the Author also removed "Ex EU or Partially EU" Countries, as well as U.S. territories that are not states. It's very difficult to read the information included about these in faint grey, so I'd improve this visualization by making it more readable. It's important to note that high rates of ceserean section don't actually correlate to birth complications- Healthy expectant mothers are commonly reccommend to schedule a C-section to 'reduce the stress of uncertainty of when the baby will come'. In reality, scheduling delivery months ahead of time allows doctors to schedule timely due dates so that they may maximize the number of babies delivered per month, thereby maximizing income. C-sections can be a life-saving procedure for women experiencing any complications during delivery, however extensive research shows that if possible natural birth leads to a smoother recovery for both the mother and baby. C-section scheduling has also led to a higher number of premature births, although not by a large margin, on average women are scheduling delivery dates a few weeks earlier than the full 40-week term, which can create potential critical health risks for the newborn and reduce the positive affects associated with interacting with the mother's microbiome in the final weeks of development and during birth. Particularly high C-section rates are recorded in Greece, where this practice is especially common. Widely available C-sections have saved countless lives internationally, and are undoubtedly an incredible tool, comprabale to how the appendectomy has saved countless lives- but you'd still be better off keeping your appendix if you didn't have a reason to surgically remove it. You could also call into question if this removes the selective pressure for babies with large heads and mothers who are prone to delivery complications, which could contribute to the higher rate of C-sections, sources included below the author's visualization include more detail about increased encouragement for C-sections in the medical field before you even begin to think logically about the improbability of over 50% of greek women experiencing complicated deliveries. It's important to note that in general, researching procedures, medications, surguries, or any treatments for a given afflication is expressly important for the patient before and after consulting a doctor. Practioners should always have your best interest in mind, and they often do, but it's good to keep in mind that this can be very lucrative field, dominated by competitive, busy people who may not view you as an individual when evaluating your needs.
