Week 4 Reflection- Carley Gilmore

Over quarantine I really liked playing Animal Crossing. I wondered if there were any data visualizations fans made to make gameplay more effective, since the game requires hours of work that you put into your island. I found a Medium blogpost from 2020 when Animal Crossing New Horizons came out. The article, called "Animal Crossing: Secret of Miles Rewards with python visualization" is posted in Dive Into DataScience (DIDS): https://medium.com/self-training-data-science-enthusiast/animal-crossing-secret-of-miles-rewards-with-python-visualization-a441aa6238f5

Based on the programmer's experience playing ACNH, they noticed that Event, Communication and Plant goals have higher rewards than other ones and can help you effectively earn Miles Rewards that can be redeemed in the game. The dataset that is visualized represents 85 activities and groups them into 12 distinct categories. The top 3 categories are revealed in a bar graph. In Python, seaborn and matplotlib were used to generate several plots that represent rewards and number of repetitions those activities occur to obtain high rewards as much as possible. You can see that the plant category is among the top three highest reward actvities and also the top on the most repeated activities. That activity equipped with golden tools allows for the highest reap of reward benefits.
