I thought this visualization was fantastic for its mini maps which are in the shape of the U.S. It really makes it easier on the viewer
to see exactly who was born where for each state. Each state appears to have small line charts inside of them indicating how many people
were born in the state, out of the state and out of the country. Even more interesting is that the charts range from 1850 on the left to 2020
on the right. I thought it was really interesting how the southern states like Texas don't have as many immigrants as I thought they would
given the number of people coming over the border. Instead, it appears the northern states like New York, Minnesota and Wisconsin have more immigrants.
Interestingly though the graphs show the number of immigrants in those states declining. Another interesting part about this graph is how many people
from out of state there are in California and Nevada! In fact I was just saying the other night how the LA Rams usually have more visiting fans at their
stadium than their own. I guess it's because there aren't as many native Los Angeles people.
