These visualizations helped me see the world is a slightly different context. I'm used to seeing either geopolitical maps, or satellite maps, and when both are overlayed it can be difficult to make out differences between one country and another. For example, I didn't realize that Madagascar, a country I had always thought to be covered in rainforests (thanks, nature documentaries), to end up more on the "Desert" scale than Angola. I wasn't aware of topographical differences between Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, and the UAE, but they're pretty pronounced on the map. I play lots of GeoGuessr, an online game that drops you into a random Google Street View, from where you guess your current location, and often get stuck picking between South Africa and Australia. It turns out that the struggle is real, both countries share remarkably similar average colors, more so than many other countries one might associate together.

Most importantly, however, the author provides samples and code with exact steps to replicate the visualizations. Even though many visualizations purport to be about science, it's easy to share an image on social media without fully understanding what it's supposed to represent or where the data came from. I'm big on interactivity, and by providing these steps, the author effectively allows you to do your own science experiment. I'm interested in online maps, and reading through blogposts like these years ago helped me build better visualizations by doing. I don't know what I (or the mapping subset of the data vis field) would be able to do without similar shared knowledge.
