This chart is used to help us understand how much data is stored in one zettabyte. A single zettabyte is the same as 10^21 bytes which is too large for our human brains to fully comprehend. By around 2015, humans have created 1 zettabyte of data. The graphic gives a single sentence that really puts things into perspective. (As of 2015,) if you watch everything on Netflix 3,177 times, you will have consumed 1 1000th of a zettabyte. In 2020, we created 59 zettabytes of data. This graphic reminds me of one I saw where pennies were stacked until they were the size of the empire state building and it was worth some large amount of money. I think that representation may be better than this one. We only see 5 groups of 1000 dots and it doesn’t really help us see the large scale very well. It’s easy to understand that they’re all being multiplied together, but without seeing how quickly it’s scaling up in magnitude, the viewer will still have a hard time imagining the immense number.
