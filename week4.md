This visualization is by u/symmy546 and shows the population density of Egypt. They generated the map using
matplotlib, numpy and geopandas. It makes sense where the population is the most dense as the red areas are lining
the Nile River, and the large splotch of red at the top is where the river splits into the Mediterranean sea. I find 
this visualization interesting because geopandas is what made doing this much simpler as it improves pythons ability
to work with geospatial data. With the knowledge that extensions like this exist, I'd be interested in finding other
add-ons for python that make doing other visualizations significantly easier, or just make the visualizations better
in general.
Something that would be interesting is comparing this map, or the map of another country that was built along a river,
and comparing it to somewhere like the south-western part of America where the Dust Bowl had massive impact on agriculture.
