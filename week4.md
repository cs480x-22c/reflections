This graph by NASA demonstrates Surface Temperature Analysis.  From 1880 to 2017 we see average monthly temperature irregularities by country.

I think this visualization gives a  good perspective of global warming,+1.0 C is indicated by orange and +2.0 C is indicated by a red circle. From the year 1960  till 2000 it's mostly oranges circles. Moving forward from 2000 to 2017 we see a spike in +2.0 c circles.

Heading back to 1880 to 1930 we see distinct spikes between -2.0 C and sometimes +2.0 c. This is expected as it occurs periodically. 

This visualization proves that global warming was a consequence of the greenhouse effect and the temperature rise isn't normal.
