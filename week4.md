There were a few things about this visualization that got my attention. First, my favorite part is when visualizations, like this one, that talk about the U.S. on a state level organize it so that the data resembles the map of the U.S. I also thought it was a good color scheme with the stacked area chart-esque usage. Because each square represents 170 years and no quantitative data is given regarding population numbers, not much numerical analysis can be done. However, overall trends throughout the years can be determined. It is interesting to see differences, such as some states getting a high increase in residents born in other states, while other states have quite the opposite trend. I'm from New York and I was surprised to see that, rather consistently, there aren't too many that were born elsewhere in the U.S. But then again, most people I know would try and leave New York if they could. I also liked how the ommitted data is given as greyed out areas on the square.
