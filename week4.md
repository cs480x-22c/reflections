Week 4 reflection

This weeks data visualization has a lot to it. The website this visualization is on is called
Serebii.net. This is a fan made website for the pokemon series. This website is one that I have been regularly frequenting
since I was relatively young. This website has lots on information on everything from the Pokemon games to the 
anime and card game. 
One of my favorite tools they offer is what they call "Pokearth". It can be found at: https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/
Pokearth is an interactive map the webiste created. Each Pokemon game takes place in a continent called a "region". 
This map stitches together these regions into one big map. The cool thing is that each map of each region corresponds to
what the map is like in the game. You can interact with each map too. You can click on any of the routes, cities, caves, or locations
that are on each map and it will take you to a page on the site which contains data about that area. This data contains
things like what pokemon are available there, what time of day they can be found in, what items can be found, what battles you can have, etc.

This website and this tool they have has been one of the best tools I've ever used while playing pokemon. It is full of data and 
can asnwer most, if not all questions you may have abuot the game.
