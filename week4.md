Made with GitHub's PYPL Data
Bar chart race is always fun to watch
Significance: tracks trends in teh CS community in the past and current years with regards to language popularity, helps us understand what is happening in the field at each given point in time and where different trends may be headed

Drawbacks:
Metric may not check out:

"The PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Index is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google : the more a language tutorial is searched, the more popular the language is assumed to be. It is a leading indicator. The raw data comes from Google Trends.

If you believe in collective wisdom, the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language index can help you decide which language to study, or which one to use in a new software project."

Is very slow, would like coverage sped up OR the implementation of a fast forward option
Only captures the top % of languages. There are few enough programming languages that this is OKAY, but a bar chart race wouldn't work for a lot of other things due to this reason
