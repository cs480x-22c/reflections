I agree with the author that isotypes are a great way to represent information. Isotypes use icons which relate to the subject matter to represent quantitative data. The visual nature of isotypes makes them more quickly and easily understandable by a larger amount of the population. One can get the jist of an isotype by quickly glancing at it. It is clear what the subject matter is without having to provide much context. This is opposed to some other visualizations such as bar charts which require more time to read and understand. You can not tell what a visualization like a bar chart represents without reading the title, axes, and/or key. In addition, the icons used in isotypes are frequently utilized for other purposes. As such, when viewers see an isotype that uses a common icon, they are more likely to know what it represents without having to read the key. In this case, the key provides more details and clarification towards the specific situation that the isotype is representing. Often, isotypes allow the viewer to gauge correlations between the subjects of the visualization. I would continue to use isotypes as a way to represent simple multiplicative data and correlations.
