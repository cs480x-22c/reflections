This graph was created by u/OvertiredEngineer (Reddit) using MATLAB. They collected the data for the graph by calculating the moving average of consumer 
download speeds over a 20 minute period. They also chose to exclude all failed speedtests which I found interesting as they could show inconsistencies 
with the service. Another part of the graph that was nice was the change in color when the internet speed dropped below a certain threshold. There is 
also software provided by the speedtest website that allows consumers to set up their own Ookla Speedtest servers. In the reddit thread, they also responded 
to someone who countered the validity of the results, stating that nothing they did with their setup could have affected the results. As for the graphing methods,
I have personally never used MATLAB so I can't speak to its the best option. From what I've seen though, I would definitely like to learn it should I need to
graph data like this.

I once had my own issues with not getting advertised download/upload speeds from our provider, and simplty changing which ethernet port my computer was plugged 
into on our modem raised my download speeds from 150mb/s to 800mb/s. This leads me to believe that the user who was countering the data was, to an extent, correct
about user error having a significant impact on download speeds.
