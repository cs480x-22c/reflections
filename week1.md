I looked at the link posted in Slack about the covid cases and stories associated with trends (https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/coronamoments/#/embedded-stories). 
I think that for starters, the layout is quite pleasant. 
The trend is obviously one that most have been closely observing for some time now, and the orange and small animations help to differentiate it from the plainer representations.
The relation of personal anecdotes to the data trend is quite clever.
I believe that this helps to humanize the data, and make it feel more relational.
The fact that there were so few dots sort of shocked me, I thought more would be present.
It is also incredibly interesting to see the anonymous self reflections of others, and how the general social conciousness changes over time.
I do think that with more anecdotes, this visualization will become much better, with more interactivity.
However, I think more anecdotes will also then be able to show the diversity in thought among various locations throughout the world.
Overall, I found this visualization interesting and intriguing. A change of pace from typical covid trendlines.
