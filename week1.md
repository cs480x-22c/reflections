Week 1 Reflection- Carley Gilmore

For this week's reflection, I was attracted to a social graph I saw on the dataisbeautiful reddit page: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/s2jg0h/oc_instagram_social_graph_of_selected/.

The creator of the graph used Python to process data as a visualization tool. The graph shows selected Instagram accounts where the edges indicate connections among followers who are following each other. There is a layout algorithm incorporated adopted by Yifan Hu where different colors represent different clusters and social groups. I thought this was very interesting because it shows how much bigger social media is when it comes to our own social groups. Regardless of social following or the size of the platform there is a way to see a pipeline that is far-reaching and make connections to other people based on the followers we have even if we are not directly related. The programmer started by using their friends' accounts, but then searched for social accounts that are public where it can be  easily  distinguished the connection among them. They highlighted the connection with a random selection criteria of the users being public, but with the knowledge that those accounts follow the same accounts or similar accounts that are linked on Instagram based on interests. The creator even gives insight on how this data visualization was created and how you can make your own social graph. The video is on Youtube called "splines programming social graphs"
