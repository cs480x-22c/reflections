The article discusses the lack of quality of data visualization in most scientific research.
I agree with their point that if this was more refined research could be better understood.
I also agree with their point that research funding would increase if donors could better visualize what the data actually represents.
I disagree with their point that pie charts are visually challenging to read when comparing different parts.
In the image pie vs bar they show, there is a lack of color contrast between the different parts of the pie chart and bar graph.
If the color contrast was better the pie chart would be just as effective as a bar graph.
I agree with the point that they make about scientist overusing the rainbow color scale.
When I look at diffrent astronomy images, I find it is often hard to tell the diffrence between visable and non-visable matter.
Scientist also use the rainbow scale when sometimes a simple gray scale is more effecive and simpler to read.
For this article, they should be using more realistic examples when arguing for a certain type of data reperesentation.
For scientist, they should spend more time on data visualization(more research/testing) as it is an important part that should not be overlooked.
