This visualization shows the life of an American from a survey of 1000 people in 2014 about their average days. 
Once on the webpage, the visualization goes live. There is a clock in the left-hand side to show the time of day. On the right, are all the dots, each representing a person. The colors and location represent the activity that the person is doing. 
The visualization starts at 4:30am – where most people are sleeping and the few people that have their lives together are up doing housework or leisure work. 
The visualization is great for multiple reasons
-	Its really easy to see what the majority of Americans are doing at any given point by looking for the biggest blob of dots
-	Along those lines, the colors also provide a great sense of what the population is doing. 
-	I also like how in each section the numerical percentage is shown. This is very helpful if two blobs look very similar in size. 
-	There is an interactive feature on the left-hand side that allows the user to view the animation in a slow, medium, and fast pace. 
-	And there is a very cute description under the clock that describes what the majority of Americans are doing at that time in a very user-friendly matter. 
    - “The day is in full swing with work or housework. Stores and services are open so people can run errands, and they take various forms of transportation to get there.”


I think this visualization is easy to understand, fun to watch, and very accommodating to the different ways that people like to analyze data.
