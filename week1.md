![Resting Heart Rate Graph](/images/RestingHeartRate.jpg)

This visualization is from the Fitbit mobile application. It shows a resting heart rate over thirty days. 
I noticed that there are no values on the x-axis, and the axes are not labeled. 
This makes it difficult to read the graph easily and find data points for specific days. 
It would be helpful to have the start and stop dates labeled, especially since the graph is over the “past 30 days”. 
The markers for the highest and lowest resting heart rates are helpful to show the range over thirty days. 
However, the graph starts at 52bpm, instead of 0bpm, and goes to 62bpm. 
This makes the data seem inflated and look like there is more of a dramatic difference than there is. 
For example, between the lowest and highest resting heart rate, there is only an 8bpm difference, but it looks much bigger than that. 
This might cause panic in someone who thinks that something is wrong with them since it looks like their resting bpm has changed drastically. 
This visualization displays the data in a clean and simplistic manner, but I think it is too simple for someone to easily extract data from.
