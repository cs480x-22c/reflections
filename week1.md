I chose to include an image of a shot chart of Giannis Antetokounmpo during the 2018-2019 Nba Season. This shot chart is interesting because, previously, scouts would look at film and shooting percentages to determine how to guard the player more effectively. With this chart, generated by the data points, nba scouts can simply look at the shot chart to see which spots the player excells more at. As we can see in the shot chart, Giannis Antetokounmpo shoots very well in the paint area (shots near the basket) and he does not take as many shots around the 3-point line and midrange. But if Giannis does take 3-pointers they are mainly from the top of the 3-point line. 

These shot charts contains a variety of information that the coach/scout can use. For example, since Giannis's threepoint/midrange percentage is not too good, this can allow the defense to build schemes to try to stop giannis from getting near the basket and make him shoot more midrange shots and shots from the wing areas. This shot chart can also help a player focus on particular shots. Since giannis likes shooting from the top of the key 3-pointer, Giannis and the staff can make him practice those three-pointers more. 

Shot charts can also be obtained for certain stretches, just not a player's career or particular season. Say if Giannis has a good January shooting three pointers, the defense can put more pressure guarding the three-pointer, and put less pressure near the basket.

Shot charts and other basketball visualizations will continue to be used and analyzed so coaches/scouts can make clearer and more informed decisions on offensive/defensive schemes
