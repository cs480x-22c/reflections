Summary/Why it's important:
This article and cooresponding video [see Works Cited below] cover Florence Nightingale's Rose Chart (aka Coxcomb Chart) and legacy. Considered the mother of nursing, Nightingale did something very unusual from April 1854 to March 1856, during the Crimean War: she collected data on causes of death at a field hospital in Scutari, noting death from disease as blue, death from battle wounds as red, and death from other causes as black; this data was collected before and after sanitary changes were made to the field hospital, and showed a significant decrease in deaths among wounded soliders [1]. The chart itself is read clockwise and spans a full year, with each wedge representing a month. Unlike a pie chart, data in the Rose Chart is scaled with radius instead of angle, giving the chart an eye-catching, sharp, and unique look [1]. With the contents of the chart and its unique looks combined, Nightingale successfully convinced the "vulgar public" (people in charge of decision making, i.e. the rulers and lawmakers) to implement better care for soldiers and more sanitary procedures for field hospitals [1]. It is worth noting that the chart is scaled correctly, but is not great for determining specific figures, and is more-so a presentational piece meant to convey the significance of the implemented sanitary changes on death count.





the chart is scaled correctly
the figureds are provided alongside a book the char was published in. the chart itself is not great for determining specific figures, but is great for conveying a sense of significance for the changes



Why it caught my attention:
Unique looking (tie in from final point of summary)
Data itself is incredibly important in modern healthcare, whether that data is being used for medical advancements or visualizatios
Visualizations in health care contribute to everything from patient care to a better informed public
