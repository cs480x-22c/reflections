I'm doing my first reflection of the app Weight Gurus which syncs with my scale.
The scale uses impedance to measure several biometrics statistics, which can be viewed along with weight in a smoothed line graph.
The two metrics I have chosen to look at the graphs for are body fat percentage and muscle mass.
The first thing I noticed upon looking at the graph is that the scaling of the graph changes to fit the deviations of the value onto the screen.
In doing this the small changes in my body fat percentage end up looking large.
This is good for seeing changes but possibly makes the changes look bigger.
Generally I find that both of these stats track with my weight changes, with body fat going up when I gain weight and muscle mass going down.
However this is not always the case, and sometimes my weight gain does not directly correlate with body fat gain.
Another statistic that accounts for what amount of weight changes are owed to gain in fat vs muscle would be helpful.
This app allows you to see the trends generally but does not easily allow the user to determine what kind of weight was gained in detail.
This addition would be helpful athletes or other individuals trying to gain or lose a specific kind of weight.
