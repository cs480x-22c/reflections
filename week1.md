This week's visualization: https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1483865527911124996

When I was looking for a visualization, I decided to try and see if I could find anything on a couple of websites, but then switched to twitter to see what I would be able to find there. Immediately when I looked up data visualization this came up, but I thought it was pretty cool. First of all, while I knew there were gif or animated visualizations out there, I hadn't really seen any so it was interesting to see.

This visualization looks at the global temperature change from 1850 to 2021. It creates a moving line as it goes around in spirals, 1 360 loop for each year. As the temperature increases from the average the larger it deviates the larger the loops get and the color slowly goes from a dark purple to a yellow at the same time to represent it both by the larger circles and the warmer colors. It's a fairly simple design but it interesting to watch as it goes from a circle of about double the radius from roughly the 1970s to now when its measuring all the way since 1850. It really showcases that the change in temperature has been increasing more recently and becoming much higher. The simple design is also very easy to understand, which makes it very appealing. The sprialing around showing the different months worked really well, and sort of resembled a clock. I believe there was one in class that had a similar setup with going in a spiral and I thought it was really cool to see one modeling it like this. I do think it would be interesting to make a spiral graphic at some point.
