- The wpi covid testing dashboard shows information about the tests returned and positive tests on campus. It shows the positivity rate for the past 7 and 30 days. There is also a new addition showing the distribution of positive cases between students, staff and faculty as well as per class. There are also timelines for tests returned and positive tests. There is a lot of good information being displayed on the webpage but disappointingly only uses tables and bar charts to display the information. The trends and overall state of the campus covid-19 situation on campus are not easily discernible at a glance. It takes careful observation and analysis of the graphs to get an idea of the campus situation, and even then I can not discern the trends given a period larger than 30 days. I would be interested in seeing a visualization that overlaps every month's timeline. This way it would be easily discernible if things are getting better or worse in comparison to previous months. This may also provide insight at a glance what  times of the month cases tend to spike, perhaps we would see a consistent spike following weekends. In conclusion, I applaud wpi's commitment to being transparent and providing lots of information, however, I would be excited to see what could be discerned by a more adventurous and advanced visualization of the data.
