This article and cooresponding video [see Works Cited below] honor Florence Nightingale's Rose Chart (aka Coxcomb Chart) and legacy. Considered the mother of nursing, Nightingale did something very unusual from April 1854 to March 1856, during the Crimean War: she collected data on causes of death at a field hospital in Scutari, noting death from disease as blue, death from battle wounds as red, and death from other causes as black; this data was collected before and after sanitary changes were made to the field hospital, and showed a significant decrease in deaths among wounded soliders [1]. The chart itself is read clockwise and spans a full year, with each wedge representing a month. Unlike a pie chart, data in the Rose Chart is scaled with radius instead of angle, giving the chart an eye-catching, sharp, and unique look [1]. With the contents of the chart and its unique looks combined, Nightingale successfully convinced the "vulgar public" (people in charge of decision making, i.e. the rulers and lawmakers) to implement better care for soldiers and more sanitary procedures for field hospitals [1]. It is worth noting that the chart is scaled correctly, but is not great for determining specific figures, and is more-so a presentational piece meant to convey the significance of the implemented sanitary changes on death count [1].

This article and video originally caught my attention due to the unique look of the Rose Chart, but quickly caught my attention due to Nightingale's and the chart's significant influence on healthcare. In my opinion, Nightingale has had a direct effect on the modern healthcare industry's sanitary practices, and is at least somewhat responsible for any modern professions involving nursing. I also think it's fascinating how Nightingale used her data: rather than trying to convince rulers and lawmakers to implement policy changes using cold hard numbers and calculations, she put the data into a format that's both attention-grabbing and easy to understand, without skewing the data representation. In modern healthcare, data itself is incredibly important for achieving medical advancements, whilst visualizations are important for patient care and establishing a better informed public. Through her heroic efforts, Nightingale and her Rose Chart achieved both of the latter, a truly incredible feat for the time period in which she lived.
