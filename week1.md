<h1> Reflection 1: Omicron Spiral Diagram </h1>

My first reflection is pertaining to this graph showing the growth of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 from 2020 to the projected growth starting off 2022. The graph itself was created by Jeffrey Shaman, a doctor who models infection diseases at Columbia University.

<h2> Reflection </h2>

The reason this visual caught my eye was due to the kind of graph Jeffery and his team used to display cases. From some quick research, I believe the name of this kind of graph is either a Spiral Diagram or Spring Diagram. They are commonly used to display a timeline, but the interesting feature of this graph is the fact that it used a set axis to display months/years using polar coordinates. 

The one problem I have with this visual is that it is a bit difficult to get an exact reading on how many cases are present at a given time. The legend gives a somewhat vague illustration describing how to read the width of the red area, representing cases. The thing about this key is that you cannot really make out how large a part of the graph is compared to this visual, so you cannot really know an exact number of cases. The graph is very good at showing how the number of cases varies throughout the years, but only in an abstract way, not numerically. For example, looking at the end of the graph, I can definitely tell you that the number of Omicron cases is going to drastically rise compared to the month before, but if you wanted to know by how much, Iâ€™d have to pinch my fingers to make a rough ruler to give you a probably inaccurate answer. I guess my main issue with it is that there is not much purpose for the legend in this visual. 

I guess with something like Covid cases, most people would not care about specific numbers, just whether or not it is increasing or decreasing. Taking that in mind, I think this spiral diagram conveys that information pretty well.
