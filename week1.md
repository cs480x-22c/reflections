The image above contains graphs which convey which pronouns (she/him) have been associated with key words and phrases over time.
I thought this data was particularly interesting because women's roles used to be more constrained to the home to do tasks like cooking,
ironing, cleaning etc. In this graphic however, you can see an increase in men who are referenced in the phrases "he cooks", "he ironed", "he scrubbed".
I also thought it was interesting that more women are being included in phrases such as "she fought". This makes a lot of sense seeing that we
have much more media now portraying women to be heroes. Modern Star Wars trilogy, Wonderwoman etc. Overall I thought the graphs were well done and clearly
portray trends. Something in particular is the color scheme of pink vs blue. I can't really find much wrong with the presentation. Line graphs are
really clear and this is no exception. The one thing is I wish it would explain which books it sampled from.
