This past week I was surprised to hear of the 67.8 billion dollar deal from Microsoft to buy Activision. I was interested to see what part of the media sector Microsoft now owns as I was worried about a monopoly being built in the video game industry from Microsoft. The graphic I found above clearly shows the addition of the Microsoft deal in the entire media industry. The graphic consists of bubbles that are titled with the parent company and inside the bubble contains all the subsidiaries of that company. These bubbles are also sized based on the market capitalization of the company itself. I found it very easy to look around and see how much of the media industry is dominated by specific companies. While the larger companies completely take over the screen and leave some of the smaller companies in the dust, I thought I was going to have trouble deciphering information about the smaller companies and their subsidiaries but I was ultimately able to get a look at these smaller companies as well. Though I was able to analyze all the companies, there is no doubt that the bigger companies in the graphic are way more easier to pick out and analyze than the smaller companies and they don't all have the same level of accessibility. For example as the bubble sizes get smaller, the subsidiaries are no longer able to be placed within the bubble and a line must be extended from the bubble instead. With so many companies or "bubbles" and so many lines stemming of each of them, it is a bit overwhelming. Overall I enjoyed this data graphic a lot because even though I had to look at it a bit more to understand everything that was going on, I still was able to. In addition to this, the big picture of the data graphic which was the scale of the big companies to the smaller companies came across very clearly.
