Kosara, Robert. "Florence Nightingale's Famous Rose Chart (aka "Coxcomb")." *YouTube*, uploaded by eagereyes - Robert Kosara, 11 May 2021, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZh8tUy_bnM.

Summary/Why it's important:
Florence Nightingale, considered the mother of nursing
Collected data on cause of death from field hospital in Scutari during Crimean war, focusing on disease (blue), battle wounds (red), and other causes (black)
Chart is read clockwisea and spans a full year, with each wedge as a month. Unlike pie chart, data is scaled with radius instead of angle, giving it it's unique look.
Nightingale collected data before and after santiary changes were made to the field hospital to show the significant decrease in deaths, and convince the "vulgar public" (people in charge of decision making, i.e. the rulers and lawmakers) to implement better care for soldiers and more snaitary procedures for field hospitals.

This "rose chart" worked because it was unique, and for that very reason it doesn't really work for other things.
chart covers Apr 1854 to March 1856, 2 circles worth of data



Why it caught my attention:
Unique looking (tie in from final point of summary)
Data itself is incredibly important in modern healthcare, whether that data is being used for medical advancements or visualizatios
Visualizations in health care contribute to everything from patient care to a better informed public
