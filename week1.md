Reflection 1: Indonesian Population Data
===

This term I am in one other class and my MQP. In the future I'd like to share some interesting visualization from both of these areas. Today I'm sharing some data from the other class I'm in, ENV1500: Intro to GIS.

This was a chloropleth map that was created for this first assignment using ArcGIS Pro. Population data for each road, city, and province was used to produce this map, and they are all used in different ways. First, the provincial data was visualized and normalized by density. Then the city data was added, and told a story that differed somewhat, so transparent rings were used to represent the cities to ensure that both the provinces and cities are visible. The color of these two are both set to purple, as it's uncommon in the world. If it was set to another color such as blue or green or red, you would likely assume that it's other things aside from population density, depending on the meanings of colors to the culture of the reader. It was also interesting to me that we learned that graduated colors with discrete color steps often aren't very useful for purposes like these, and you almost always want to opt for a continuous color scale instead because it says more about the data. Furthermore, in terms of maps, dark almost always implies more, and light is less.

Roads were turned into dotted lines to make them look different from borders or rivers, and then used the data to separate the primary roads, such as highways and main roads, from secondary backroads, and added discrete color steps for that. Finally, the background world map had to be edited so not to distract the reader with the dense forestation in Papua New Guinea or an underwater trench, as well as to check it for accessibility purpose, such as red-green color blindness. 

For anyone with interests in chloropleth maps, here's a blog post by Lisa Charlotte Muth that you might like to explore [on the Datawrapper website](https://blog.datawrapper.de/choroplethmaps/). It's got a lot of great guidelines regarding when to use chloropleth maps, the units to use when designing them, and the colors involved.
