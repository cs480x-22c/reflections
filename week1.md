This image (r1.png in lilygarfinkel/reflections) was the first thing that caught my eye when I opened this website. It was across the top with the title "How Popular Is Joe Biden?". While I later realized it is just a preview for a larger visulization with a more extensive description, I found it very difficult to understand what it was trying to portray. The lines are too big for the graph, and the lack of any kind of legend, except for random approval ratings on the sides, makes it difficult to understand what is being measured. In fact, the only reason I clicked on it was to see what was actually being talked about. The larger graph that is on the page linked to the preview (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo) makes the data much easier to understand, and gives actual values for what is being measured. It is actually very comprehensive, as it is interactive and also cites many sources. Overall, the preview looks like it was done with little thought. This is probably not that important in real life, as there was a better representation of the data attached, however is was very misleading at first. This would not work as a stand alone graph.
