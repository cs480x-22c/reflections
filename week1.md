For my first reflection, I went and looked at the [Music Map](music-map.com) website. 
This website allows you to type in any musical artist and it will generate a map of other artists that is likely to share fans with whoever you typed.
These other artists who show up are roughly ranked by proximity to the one you searched--the closer the artist, the larger overlap in fans.
There is not a lot of data provided as to where this data is being drawn from, just that it is part of something called "GNOD - the global network of discovery".
Whatever that means.
However, the visualization of this data is consistently accurate (to my understanding of artists that I have searched for)
and is efficient in communicating what needs to be gotten across.
When you click on any artist that shows up, it opens their respective map, so it is well designed to go down a rabbit hole from artist to artist.
For example, I can go from 100 gecs -> Caroline Polachek -> Dua Lipa -> One Direction -> The Beatles.
I think this visualization is super interesting to see what artists you can connect by overlap in fanbase in as few connections as possible,
kind of like a makeshift 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon.
It's also useful as a tool to discover artists you may like based on ones you already know about.
The main flaw here, I'd say, is that as a data visualization, it uses data to show you visuals, but there's too little access to the data.
The website doesn't provide you any clear way of seeing WHY any given artist shows up nearby to another, and that's a pretty significant issue in my opinion.
If hovering over a given name gave you some form of stat or reasoning for the connection, I think that would significantly improve and strengthen the visual.
