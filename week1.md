This is a visulization of the crowds energy at the Allianz Areana in Germany.

This visulization shows the most pivital moments within the match based on crowd energy. This data is also displayed along side 
the tweets about the match in a bar chart using differnt colors to seperate the two. The data line up pretty closely which I found facinating.
Additionally the sound data is displayed as a sound visualizer around a stadium designed showing the average sound levels
in the sections of the stadium. I though the combination of these two told a really compelling story. This visualization uses only four sound levels
which doesn't paint the full story but allows for data to appear more segregated.
Finally there was also a section where you can determine which player has the most vocal support. This was visuaized using a bar chart.
The bar visualization also included the players name, average fan energy produced, their total fan energy, key moments, goals, and assists.
I chose this data visualziation because it was a stastic that I wasn't aware was ever measured and I found it extremely entertaining to look through.
