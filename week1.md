For this week, I looked at the following visualization: https://endhomelessness.org/resource/data-visualization-homeless-population-representation-by-location/

I wanted to see and understand a problem that is so often talked about : Homelessness in the US. 
This visaulization was created through a demographics project which compares the different types of people who end up homeless.
I noticed that there are many more black people than any other race that is homeless. The graph shows both the total population perecentage as well as the homeless population.
This graph clearly displays the disproportions among the population and the homeless population. Asian and white people are under represented in the homeless population.
The hispanic population is accurately represented compared to the total population percentage. 
It is very powerful to include the total population and demographics, so that viewers are able to draw their own conclusions about homelessness,
and how it effects different populations.

The visualization also showed how there are many more men than women who are homeless. 72% of the homeless population is men, while only 27% are women.
