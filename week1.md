These visualizations are from Samsung Health as collected by a Samsung smartwatch. 
While it looks like the image is cropped horizontally, this is how the visualizations actually appear on the app. I think this gives an impression of being cramped and misaligned. 
The 31 day view makes sense from a content perspective, but is too much information to meaningfully display on a phone screen in the manner they attempt.
The vertical axis is not based on zero which makes small differences appear larger.
The max-min data is hard to parse visually and that makes it harder to gather key insights.
I do like the low opacity average HR range display on the line chart since it makes it easy to compare values against some average in order to get useful information about one's heartrate.
However, I am confused by the labels in red on that graph. I assume this is the user's personal average, but the visualization does not indicate this in any way.
