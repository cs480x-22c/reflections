For my week one reflection, I looked at [Visualizing Harmony in Western Art Music by Kelly Schroer](http://kellyschroer.com/harmony.html).
In this visualization, Schroer uses a circas graph to represent harmonies throughout the history of western music.
Each color represents a note and the connections represent notes played at the same time with thickness being the number of times the notes are played.
Although the stated goal of the author is to show the evolution of Western music, I feel that the visualization only does a good job showing differences between specific pieces even though the author felt the pieces were representative of the areas.
First off, I feel like the dataset was too small and I think this would have been straightforward to address.
Rather than only focusing on solo piano pieces in the key of C, I think the author could have converted all the chords to Roman numerals, so she could get at relationships between notes. 
As it stands right now, only diads are represented; however, they could represent multiple chords.
For instance in the key of C, C and E could represent both the I chord or the vi chord.
These serve different harmonic functions, but in the current diagram, they both chords are represented by the same connection.
Rather than focusing on one piece, perhaps the author should analyze a multitude of pieces from a time period all converted to Roman numerals with the thickness representing the percent of total.
Additionally, from watching the videos included of theses pieces, some of the pieces are actually multiple smaller sections. For instance, the Trio section of Mozart's Sonatina is actually in the key of F which may alter the data. Sechs Kleine Klavierstucke is actually six smaller pieces.
My main contentions with this visualization is the data source used. 
As a visualization method, the circas graph definitely catches my attention and it would be interesting to see with more robust data.
