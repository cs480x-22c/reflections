# Reflections for week 1

This week we were introduced to D3 and its powerful tools. I have never worked with D3 before, but I've used another JS library called ChartJS, Unlike D3, where you can manipulate everything of an SVG, ChartJS comes with a lot of "pre-defined" graphical implementations. In addition to that, it is super easy to implement it with React. I might try to use something from it for the next projects!
