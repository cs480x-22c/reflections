While looking around the astronomy data visualization community I found [BOLIDES - Visualizing meteorites](https://bolid.es/), which uses a dot plot to show the number of eye-witnessed meteorite impacts between 861 (the earliest recorded) and 2016. The x-axis displays years, and the positive and negative y-axes represent count and mass respectively. Overall I think that this visualization looks pretty good, the color scheme matches the theme of meteorite impacts well and it is easy to understand. It is interactive so you can click on individual years to view a list of eye-witnessed impacts in that year. 

There were a handful of critiques that I came up with while playing around with this visualization. I noticed that the x-axis doesn't have a consistent scale. This was probably done to make the visualization fit on the screen without needing a scrollbar and to leave out large gaps of empty space. If you just want to look at it quickly this isn't a huge problem but it is something to be aware of if you're trying to do a more in depth analysis, as the graph would look very different with a properly scaled x-axis. 

One problem that I noticed is that this visualization is kind of misleading. I think it should say somewhere that these are the <em>record</em> eye-witnessed meteorite impacts. The increase in eye-witnesses in later years reflects the fact that more recent observations are well-documented. I suspect that there were way more impacts witnessed earlier on, it's just that these were either not recorded or the documentation has since been lost.
