Adam McCann's "An Analysis of the Beatles?" visualization displays songwriting data
about The Beatles discography, specifically the songwriting habits of each member.
It uses color scaling in combination with a scatterplot and a pie chart to link
together the success, time period, and writer of hit Beatles songs. I enjoy how
these three individual visualizations interact with each other. However, I think the
rainbow color scale is a bit difficult to interpret. I would have preferred it to be on
a scale using saturation or luminance instead.

The "Which Songwriter Has the Largest Vocabulary" section is fascinating to look at, but 
a bit unintuitive. A song's position on the y-axis is determined by how many unique words
the song has, but the visualization does not define what a "unique" word is. The songs
to be organized on the x-axis (within each individual songwriter's chart) in alphabetical
order. This information is not very meaningful, and I think it would make more sense to
instead organize it by the release date of the song, which might reveal some trends in
the data.

Overall, the visualization is very interactive and effectively displays a lot of data.
It highlights specific graphics when mousing over them and displays text boxes with
further information. It also includes a search function to find specific songs, which
makes the visualization a lot easier to navigate through. I would have liked to see
a bit more polish in displaying the data meaningfully, but McCann's visualization
does a very effective job at visualizing Beatles songwriting data.
