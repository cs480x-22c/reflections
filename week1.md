Week 1 reflection

This week's data source was: https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-global-overview-report


I enjoy reading or seeing data that aligns with a topic that I have an interest in. One of my biggest interests within the last
2 years or so has been how social media and technology usage has affected us as a population. Whether its on a Reddit post or
Netflix documentary, I love finding out about how we are being affected both negatively and positively. This site provided 
lots of data on internet use and breakdowns. Some interesting data included Time increase in mobile device usage being around 20% in 2021 (increase from 2020)
and 92% increase in mobile time spent using applications. 

In addition, the data showed an increase in number of global social media users of 13.2%
which equated to about 490 million people. This number specifically was interesting to me. Within the last 3 years, I have become very aware
of the damage that social media has been having to us as society. With the recent pandemic, these numbers aren't surprising,
but they are alarming in my opinion. People are being forced into being and interacting with one another online, and forgetting how to 
socialize outside that virtual environment. Furthermore, with the rise of social media stars and those seen as "popular",
many children start having mental problems at a young age because they want to strive to live the lives that they see others living behind their screen.


I came across the previously stated website and was immediately drawn to it. For me, when I look at data I look for a few things.

First, how clean is the data. I am a very visual person. I like using my eyes to interpret what I see. There has been many instances
in my previous classes where someone is giving a presentation, and they are using colors that clash in their graphs or charts. Sometimes
they will have charts with very tiny words that are hard to read or will use yellow text on an orange background (yes this actually did happen...) and it 
really makes it frustrating to be able to understand what you are looking at. Also, if someone uses clunky or distracting images it makes it very
annoying to try to understand what the person is trying to relay.

Second, I like data that provides sources. We live in an information age. There are loads of lies, deceptions, and misinformation that
get spread constantly. Visual data is not safe from this manipulation. It's very easy to throw together some alarming looking charts,
slap on an eye grabbing headline in big bold letters, and convince people of a lie you made up for views or clicks. So, I tend to look
for charts that have some sort of citation or reference to where the data was gotten from. Then I tend to make sure the source is reputable and actually exists.

The data I found for this week, checked both of those off. The author has a dark background with bright images. They also use white text to make it easy to read.
What I really liked about their setup was they included both heavily detailed bar graphs with lots of words and numbers, but also included
cleaner visualizations that had summarizations or percentages from their data. This made understand what I was looking at a lot easier.

Overall, I feel the context of this data is important. The increased use and reliance of our society on social media and technology 
has been increasing at an alarming rate. This site displayed this issue in a beautiful and clear way.
