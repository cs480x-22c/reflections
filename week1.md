This data was published by the world bank.  The consequences of COVID  play out differently in each country's economy. This visualization from National Geographic does a good job at showing how the covid impacts each country. 

It is clear that from the year 2000 to around 2019 these countries were doing better at battling poverty. Unfortunately, there is a spike in poverty.  Millions of people are going deeper into poverty. This data was published in October 2020. This makes me think how much worse would this chart look today with Omicron and the pandemic still going on.

These are the hidden costs of the pandemic.  What is interesting is that countries categorized by the world bank as middle-income and lower-middle-income are hit the hardest. More people are going into poverty than ever before. Looking at the gray line we can see the pre-pandemic forecast. The pre-pandemic- forecast appears like we are taking steps backward at battling poverty around the world.
