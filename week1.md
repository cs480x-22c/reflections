For this reflection, I wanted to analyze the Bloomberg Green Data Dash - Global Temperature Change data visualization. There are a lot of digital plots online of the trend of global temperatures. However, I find this one particularly good. First of all, the visualization itself. It uses reputable sources (NOAA), giving ethos to the plot.<br>
Moreover, it conveys monthly data through a vertical stack of points. This has two good results:
1. Each vertical line is a single year, making the plot more compact.
2. It clearly shows the yearly range of temperature, allowing to compare yearly ranges with each other more easily.
3. I like that the plot contains a white line for the medium temperature of the year.

Unfortunately, the color they chose (white) makes it difficult to see that line when the data points are light blue. Putting the y-axis on the right side is especially good because its distance is near the recent data points. Also, I personally looked first at the trend (going left to right) and then noticed the bar and quantified that increase more quickly than jumping back to the left side of the plot.
<br>The hover animation and info-box providing the value for each box are also helpful. However, it would have been nice if the average temperature line was also interactive to see the values over time. Also, the points are a bit small, making precise interactions tricky. I think the designers also picked a great color palette. The reds make it really evident that the temperature is too high and stress the importance of this problem.
<br>Overall, I think that this data visualization is exceptionally well done. Some changes in space usage, average temperature color, and animations would provide an even further insightful experience.
