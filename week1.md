This data visualization shows the 7 day average of new COVID cases per capita in the US. I think this is unique way to show the 7 day average of COVID cases compared to many others that we've seen since the pandemic started. Many other maps use a heat map to represent how many cases are in an area. Usually this is only by state and you have to zoom in the see each county. However, this visualization allows you to see all the counties in the country at the same time.

Another benefit to this visualization is it uses height of the circle and line along with color to represent the number of COVID cases. This allows more accurate representation of the amount of cases unlike a heat map that has only a certain amount of colors and those colors represent an entire range of numbers. By using height, the visualization only needed to use two colors where red represented a very high amount of cases. I think this way of visualizing the number of COVID cases still easily shows where cases are high, but does in a different way than most.

A disadvantage to this map is since it uses the height to represent COVID cases, you need to put the map at an angle which mean you can't show as much area. For example, it was very hard to see the number of cases in Alaska because the map curved and cut it off and you can't see Hawaii at all. Another disadvantage is since the circles move up and down, you won't be able to hover over each county to get additional information. On another map from Georgia Tech, you are able to hover over each county and it shows information, such as the immunization rate. On the NY Times map, they show you the 14 day trend for each county.
