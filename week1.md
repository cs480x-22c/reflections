This graphic is a visual representation of all man made satellites in space. It is separated into categories of orbit by horizontal lines (Low Earth Orbit, Medium Earth Orbit, Geosynchronous Orbit, and Other). Horizontally, it is organized by the country that owns the satellite. Each dot is also differentiated by size for size, color for category of purpose, a symbol drawn on for class (commercial, civil, academic, and defense), and shade for launch date. Finally, there are also ring and dot (a small white dot in the middle of the bigger dot) modifiers for Highly elliptic orbits and U.K. owned respectively. The chart offers us a lot of data, but it can be overwhelming to take in all at once. While it may be easy to take information about the number and size of satellites in each type of orbit, it is somewhat difficult to make conclusions about the classes of satellites because the symbols are very mixed in instead of sorted. The different shading for time of departure is almost impossible to get anything from because the shades all look very similar (at least for my colorblind self). Finally, the winding lines make it somewhat harder to tell numbers outside of category as there is a variation of both width and height between groupings. The most useful information you can get from this chart is which countries use how many satellites for what purpose. If you look at the chart, it is very easy to tell that the U.S. has significantly more satellites for communication purposes and China uses more satellites for navigation than any other country.
