Data Vis: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/szndao/maritime_traffic_in_the_ports_of_new_orleans_and/

I chose this data vis because it reminded me of what my group is trying to do for our project (map out migration patterns on the map). I liked how they modeled the boats moving as those beams and then had them tail (taper off) and have a trail following them. We were thinking of doing something with at least changing the color as time goes on so you can see what happened most recently. The tail is a nice touch I appreciate and it reminds me of what my group for a modeling class wanted to do to model actin. The colored names on the side are kind of confusing to me on whether that's how many of them there is or which ones are there? It seems as though there's multiple but not hundreds. I was wondering if it was the name of one ship but I was confused as to why there were multiple of that color then. I also don't know a lot about boats, the number might be the model of ship like an airplane? Either way, I like the way it shows them moving and that its zoomed in to where it's occuring. We would like to on our map be able to zoom in if possible because that would be super helpful to see smaller patterns that don't go very far. Looking at the numbers again it seems as though theres 3000+ boats but I it doesn't seem like there is that many visualized so I am  a little confused about that.
