This visualization was created by Reddit user u/-Montse- and they used Plotly to make both both the plot and the table.
I was quite surprised when looking through this list to see that milk takes less water to produce than beef as they
both come from the same source and one is a liquid. The same goes for leather, I guess theres a lot of water that goes 
into growing the cow to a good age and then probably more water goes into treating the leather.

One thing that was good about this visualization was showing three different sources of water that are used to produce
the product. WHile this was good, the implementation wasn't perfect as the plot on Reddit isn't super high resolution
and the oom is kind of blurrly. This makes it hard to see the weighting for different water sources on the smaller
bars like tea, beer, and wine. Though its hard to see the bar chart in some cases, the table below is very helpful as
you can see the number representations of the water footprint for each common product (still not as good as being able
to zoom on a higher resolution image or chart).
