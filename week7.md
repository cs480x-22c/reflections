This visualization from r/dataisbeautiful shows the net migration both into and out of California from about 2015 to 2019. I thought this was interesting since our final is based on migration patterns, and this is a nice example of it relating to people instead of animals. Although it has the legened, the sheer number of lines makes it difficult to determine the approximate amount of people going to or coming from each region. But while observing this, there were still a few surprises to me. The first one being the number of people going to Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is. I know Vegas is a popular destination, but never really viewed as somewhere that many people would go to stay for an extended period of time. I also think that just because of the county, the legend for outgoing people is significantly different because not too many lines come nearly close to as many people. And there definitely doesn't seem to be the same number of people coming to any county in California either. Along with the number of lines, the user that posted this said the thicker lines are on top so it is more difficult to see the true number, but having the thinner lines on top would probably be a giant mess. It is interesting to see that some of the larger lines leaving California point toward other cities like Houston and Dallas in Texas, or up to Seattle in Washington. So it could be some people want the city living but possibly want to be somewhere more affordable. It also seems to be that the majority of those coming to California originally resided in the Northeast and the Midwest.
