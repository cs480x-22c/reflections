The visualization I've chosen for this week's reflection is a recently updated map (literally less than a day old as this is being written) of the ongoing conflict which sparked in Europe last week, the most brazen attempt to redraw borders since WWII begun by Russia invading Ukraine on multiple eastern fronts. The author of the visualization shown, a map of the current state of the invasion as of 2/27/22 2:42PM, also works with multiple contributors on a live map that shows the progress of the conflict in real time which is linked above. 

The visualization helps give meaning and explanation to the current conflict for those unfamiliar with the geography of ukraine. The visualization uses a combination of color saturation as well as symbol-coded bubbles to represent invaded territory as well as pockets of conflict in their nature. Legends are incldued to provide increased context about the areas subject to heavy bombing, as well as important information designated to special colors, like Moldova's support of Russia in the southwest. This map intentionally highlights the progress of the Russian invasion and not the Ukrainian response, to avoid spreading information that could be potentially harmful to Ukraine. 

Despite being incredibly informative about a rapidly changing topic, there are some visual improvement that can be made to the given map. If I could improve this visualization I'd enlarge it so the text was more readable, and I'd provide english alphabetical translations of the locations listed on the map so they may be more easily identified. It's important to note that while the author was able to cite multiple reputable international news sources for the data shown, typically it's difficult to get a truly accurate picture of the number of casualties based on what's reported. No one is immune to propaganda, and data is often manipulated when government is under extreme pressure. Many speculate the death toll to be higher than what's shown. While this historic conflict has ended Switzerland's 207 years of neutrality to support Ukraine as well as Germany and the majority of the EU's pacifiscm, creating unity across Europe, it's undebatable that an immediate ceasefire would be the most benenficial thing for the people of Russia and Ukraine alike.
