This visualization communicates the number of refugees and fleeing Ukraine and their destinations.
The number of refugees and their destination is communicated by the arrows, with their width representing the number and their location denoting their destination.
The fact that the arrows branch off from an original path with a width representing the total number of refugees aids in discerning the proportions of refugees going to each location.
The refugees heading towards Russia are denoted with a seperate arrow, which is also colored gray to the other arrows' yellow.
This editorial choice is likely to represent that they are fleeing to the nation which is instigating the conflict, meaning that their impact on geopolitics will be different.
In this light it is interesting that Belarus is included within the bundle of yellow arrows headed primarily towards westward facing nato affiliated nations, as they are a russia aligned state that has aided in the invasion.
The arrow for the 34,000 refugees headed to other European countries are not included in the main bundle of arrows, which makes the usefulness of using the branching arrows to discern proportionality.
If I were to redesign this I would include the arrow for the other European countries between the arrow for Poland and the arrow for Belarus, having it continue through poland. I would also move the label for the total refugee count further right, allowing the original width of the yellow arrow to be more easily seen.
