- This visualization shows stock values in 2022. By using bubble clusters we can see not only how the value of the biggest companies change but also how the industry changes. Bubbles are clustered by industry and colored accordingly, which makes it very easy for the viewer to see market trends. Note that the colors picked are all very differentiable from each other to make it clear. The visualization uses the size of the bubble to represent the magnitude of the value of the company and represents the change in value as a percentage on the y axis. Using percentage growth, instead of just numerical growth is very effective because it allows for a fair comparison between bigger and smaller companies and industries. It's interesting to see how all the industries seem to slightly rise and fall in a cyclical manner. This visualization is great at giving you an idea of how the stock market varies in a short time frame. I think it would be very interesting to be able to also see this in a time frame of a year and 10 years. This would give perspective of how market variability is different to market growth and how they relate in different time frames.
