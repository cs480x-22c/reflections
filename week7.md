For my reflection this week, I found an article on flowingdata.com containing 19 maps of the United States. There are many interesting data visualizations here from ‘states that end with the letter a’ to ‘top states of the United States’ and more. There’s a couple animated visualizations, one showing the United States growing and shrinking with time and another that highlights different states in black, white, or orange. My favorite visualizations in this article are the ones that show just how united we are as Americans. For maps 9 through 18, we have states with “population greater than 0”, “borders”, “land”, “areas shaded in black”, “a name that is not ‘Marty McFly’”, “access to sunlight”, “people who sleep at night”, “vegetarians who eat meat”, “at least 26 toilets”, and “representatives in the house of representatives.” Americans have a lot more in common than we may think and these maps show that, no matter what state you live in, you’re just another human whose life is as meaningless as this article. Besides just jokes, there's a couple sort of interesting maps here. One of them puts states into groups by their first letter. This visualization isn’t half bad as it conveys that the most common first letters of states are ‘m’ and ‘n’. It also sends the message that 7 letters don’t have a state that starts with them. Probably the most interesting piece of information I got from this article is that 38% of the states end in the letter ‘a’. What’s up with that? One that most people would love to know is “What are the top states of the USA?” If you said “any state bordering Canada” then you would be right.
