This visualization is an interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It was made using Google maps, and as such has a very clean interface and map texturing. The map colors in regions of Ukraine based on whether they are occupied by Russian forces, disputed, or controlled by Ukraine. It also has icons showing various conflicts between Russian and Ukrainian forces, with a different color for outdated and ongoing conflicts. 

The map is a good way to visualize the invasion and the current state thereof. However, it is hard to tell how accurate the information on it is. It seems to have been put together and maintained by a group of hobbyists, and their sources are generally scattered across websites like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. With such a massive, quickly evolving conflict, I do wonder if the map's information is entirely accurate. Many of the sources seem to be in either Russian or Ukrainian, so it is difficult to verify that the map's descriptions match up with the source. Additionally, many of these social media accounts are unverified. They could be the accounts of Ukrainian civilians, but they may also be accounts trying to gain social media publicity from the war.

The visualization displays its data very nicely and seems to be an honest attempt at informing people about the war in Ukraine. I do worry about whether or not the data the creators are using for the map is entirely accurate, however.
