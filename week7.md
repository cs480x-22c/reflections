This visualization demonstrates the history of the deadliest pandemics in human history. When initially looking at this graph, it is particularly interesting to note the unique visuals of the graph. Each pandemic is represented by a three-dimensional virus-looking objects which makes the visualization fun to look at. On the other hand this can make it somewhat difficult to easily compare sizes of the data points (representing death toll of that pandemic). This is because volume is one of the more difficult visualization methods to perform comparisons on, particularly for sphere-like objects.

Other aspects of the visualization provide more interesting data. Some text gives additional information on some of the deadliest pandemics, while a sorted list at the bottom allows readers to compare death tolls more accurately. In particularly it is interesting to note that there are many pandemics that have been significantly deadlier in the past compared to COVID-19, showing the enormous impact of those pandemics. Overall the color scheme and visualization makes this interesting to look at, but focuses less on utility of visualization than it could. It is particularly appropriate for a lay audience.
