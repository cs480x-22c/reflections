As the title of this chart states, it is a data visualization of the accumulated D20 die rolls in the popular DnD based show, "Cititcal Role". The vis is unique, with dots falling into their respective roll-value spots pachinko-style as episode number progresses, from episode 1 to episode 115. Each dot that falls is also color coordinated according to who rolled it, and the graph is very well paced time-wise, in my opinion. Additionally, the data used was compiled by fan group @CritRoleStats.

As far as the graph itself is concerned, it's a little hard to tell how exactly how many rolls fall into each value-category, but it's definitely possible. However, it is very easy to tell which value-categories had more rolls realtive to others. I also think it's interesting that values 10-20 have a disproportionately higher number of rolls than 1-10, with 10 and 20 having the most rolls. I wonder if the show uses dies slightly weighted between these numbers in order to make rolls a bit more exciting, since constantly making low rolls isn't as fun or entertaining. Maybe a few thousand rolls isn't quite enough to balance out probabilities for a 20 sided die, but when the entire top half of values rolled is greater than the entire bottom half of values rolled, it is a bit suspicious.

Because the graph is a video, there's no interactivity, but if made into something interactive I'd like to see the ability to choose a dot and see which episode it was rolled on, what it was rolled for (stat check, saving throw, attack, etc...) in context, though that may be asking a bit much of the group that compiled the data set, since the first 115 episodes contains an enormous amount of content.
