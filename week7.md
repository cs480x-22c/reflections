Olympic Feathers, made by Nadieh Bremer is an interactive visualization that shows all summer Olympic gold medal winners from 1896 to 2016.
Each feather represents a discipline in the Olympics. Each color represents countries that fall under the five different colored rings in the Olympic symbol 
and each ring represents a year the Olympics occurred. In addition, the white dots indicate that a world record was broken. 
I found it interesting that there were no Olympic games in 1940 and 1944. If you hover over these rings, it tells you that there were no Olympics due to World War II. 
This visualization not only provides interesting data but also intriguing historical facts about the Olympics. If you hover over each individual square within the rings, 
a tooltip pops up. This tooltip includes the event, discipline, the athlete's name, the country and region they are from, as well as where the Olympics were held and in
what year. I really enjoyed this visualization because it shows multiple dimensions of the data in a simple way. Throughout this course, I have become a huge fan of Nadieh 
Bremer and her work.
