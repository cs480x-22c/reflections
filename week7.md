Week 7 Reflection

This week's reflection, I found a graphic that relates to the current issue going on between Russia and Ukraine.
It can be found here:

This graphic shows people fleeing Ukraine. What's cool about this graphic is that it shows an image of the part of Europe
where Ukraine is. The big circle indicates how many people have fled Ukraine. Then, there are streaks that end in circles 
that land in differnt European countries. This is a really cool way to indicate where people are going after leaving Ukraine.
The circles that land at each country also have a number. This number indicates how many of that 1.1m people have gone to each country.
I personally like this visual as it is very simple. THe color choice is minimal while also being effective. I think it is also
really eye opening as to what is going on in Europe at the moment and how close each country really is to one another.
