I think this is a very good grid visualization of users and hashtags transmitting fake news in Ukraine.

The big green ball was very interesting to me. The red dots are Twitter users and the green dots are hashtags. Co-occurrences are the green links. We see that most of the hashtags are linked together with each other. It is interesting to look at this data. This has nothing to do with the war since the article was published in June 2021. This shows that tensions were high in Ukraine.
