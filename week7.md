I am not a huge fan of this visualizaiton. While it is trying to show connections over a large domain of data, I feel like a different style of graph, like a table, might have made this data a bit easier
to imterpret. The lines are small, hard to follow and fade out before they get to their destination point. This makes them seem unnecessary, and makes the graph seem cluttered. I do think that color coding the 
packages by language used made it a bit easier to digest than if it were monochromatic. However, I do appreciate that the text is big and the quantities underneath them are large as well.
