With the invasion of Ukraine, this week I found a visualization showing how much gas other countries in Europe import from Russia. With so many sanctions under way, certain countries will be affected more than others. Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria and Lativa are all very reliant on Russian natural gas. 
It seems the sanctions by Germany will effect Russia the most, as it seems to be importing the most gas. The use of colors and arrows make this visualization dynamic. It was good choice to show both a countries dependance on Russian gas as well as the total gas imports to see the full story from Russia's perspective (how much the sanctions of a country may affect them) vs. the sanctioning country's perspective (how much they will suffer by giving up Russian gas).
