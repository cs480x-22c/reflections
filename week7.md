This week I wanted to look for a data visualization that was the compound work of many data sets. Until this point, most of the data
I have observed is within a single data set and cross-references said data internally. This visualization is the culmination of a digital
experiment that aggregates a plethora of demographic variables combed with death statistics. Then generating an interactive data visualization,
able to somewhat creatively and accurately predict the potential cause and timeline for a specified death. 
While that is a strong hyperbole, the outcome given is a statistically significant one. 
Moving forward I would like to use data visualization to be able to assume about a cross-compared data set.

!!!! I have not been doing these in the corresponding weeks I just now realized so this one is for the reflection due:b 2/21/22 !!!!

This is a data visualization of dialauge lines from Star Wars. The data is accumulated from the entire series. It focuses on dialauge from
6 Characters all of which being main characters. This data visualization stood out to me because most of the previous vixualiations I have
oberved are ojectively science based. This visualization is the first I have encounted with a theme that plays into the interactivity
of the viz. This visualiztion uses dots to mark dialogue with the size of dots entailing the force of the line on other characters. 
Additionally, the position of the dots (high or low) indicated whehter the dialogue has a positive or negative sentiment. These are 
techniques that we have seen and used within our project before. Moreover, there is interactivty in selecting the data we want to see, 
which is also something we have been talking about in class. The portion of this viz that stands out is that it uses its theme to make
sense to its viewer. It is only readable if you understand the morality of light and dark and how much that atters within the scope of 
star wars. Being a fan of these movies increases the impact the visualization can have. I found this to be very unique among the 
visualizations I had seen before.

This is my refleciton for 2/28/22 still not sure if I am turning these in correctly.

This data vizualization is representing every connection between every single character in the star-wars universe. I chose this 
viz because of how entirely useless it is and yet still is very visually stunning and can have meaning through that. If one were to
attempt to read this viz with the intent to discren any real data, they would find themselves hard pressed to figure out what is going
on. Rather this visualizaiton finds its value through how one might interpret the piece as art. With a general grasp of star-wars
being good versus evil you could find real value in the  art displayed here. Rather than overwhelming an onlooker with too much detail,
this visualization achieves the effect of being able to tell the overall story of light and dark conections throughout the whole verse.
This is the type of data-visualization that, while having the technical knowledge to complete, is entirely impossible to make without
a creative mind. This breaks most of the rules layed out normally and yet still achieves its goal.
