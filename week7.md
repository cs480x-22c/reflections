Data Visualization: https://podio.com/site/creative-routines


This visualization looks at the creative routines of famous creative people. At the top, there is a timelne of the day by the hour. There are different categories that are looked at such as sleep, creative work, daily job, food/leisure, exercise, and other. Each category is color coded. You can select any amount of categories to look at as the timeline of each famous person fills up. This allows the user to compare the categorical groups among the different famous people. This data is more exploratory because it allows the user to compare in a very generalized manner. 

I really enjoyed the interface of this visualiztion it was easy and the colors made it very pleasant to look at. I think it would have been nice to include the percentages of each category between the famous people. This would make it easier to compare among them. I think it also would have been really nice to include a fun bio about each famous person whne hovered over the person.
