The data visulization shows the meteorite impacts from recorded history.
Then data visualization has 2 parts.
The top part is a map with different circles of varying opacity and size.
I agree with how they made size relative to how heavy a meteorite was.
I agree with their use of opacity to make the circles easier to see.
I disagree with the scale they used for circle size.
This is because smaller circles are hard to see with the scale they selected.
The bottom part is filled with information relating to the data visualization and some other smaller scale data visualizations.
I agree with the time graph they included.
The time graph is effective at showing the spike in meteorite recording as technology became more advanced.
Overall I think the data visualization looks really good and provides a "good enough" representation for meteorite crashes.
