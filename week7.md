This chart shows the history of a person's romantic and similar relationships.
The height of the bars indicates the number of words shared with a person over Facebook Messenger. This could possibly be indicative of the strength of the relationship (though I don't know that, since I have only ever been in one).

There is a version with, and one without, contextual notes about the subject's personal history.

While this is interesting and makes sense for a person who primarily experiences their relationships through text channels, I can't be sure it would work for me.
