The 2018 Farm Bill was meant to legalize hemp, which is a type of cannabis that can be made into a variety of products. However, because of the variety of products that hemp can be made into, this Farm Bill created a market for synthetic THC which is marijuana’s primary intoxicant. Even in places where marijuana is illegal, this product is able to be sold legally. FiveThirtyEight purchased hemp derived THC products to test and found illegal levels of THC in them and other compounds that could not be identified. It is debated if these hemp derived THC products are actually legal, but this loophole in the bill has allowed people to legally sell these products. 
	This visualization is explaining the Farm Bill loophole. There are three molecules drawn up, one of CBD, Delta-8-THC, and Delta-9-THC. These molecules look pretty similar, which is the point of the viz, to show how similar in structure the molecules are. On the left, the molecule of CBD is what has been legal in the US. The next picture to the right is what CBD has been converted to, and then the image on the right is Delta-9 which is the same ingredient as the main ingredient in marijuana. The captions above each image help explain this, and I think that the order that the images on the page are placed makes sense. In addition, I think that it is difficult to make a point proving that things are similar, usually people want to visualize graphs that have outliers or a difference in data, not showing that data is the same. The molecular structures are a good use of visualizing this, as opposed to a basic graph or just the written article itself. Overall, I think that this is a really good visualization that further explains the article’s point. One question that this has me left with is: what is the actual law about how to identify substances? Does the law go by molecular structures or just by the name of a product? If they go by molecular structures, how is Delta-8 legal?
