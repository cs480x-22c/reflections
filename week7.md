I found this visualization from last year on DataIsBeautiful: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mpm6w0/oc_where_every_plastic_ever_made_ended_up/?utm_content=body&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_name=78c454ce6c4f44ff8715854cc09e74a7&utm_source=embedly&utm_term=mpm6w0. It shows where plastic goes after production and the percentages that go to each location (in use, incinerated, landfill, ocean). I think that the blue dots represents plastic that was recycled, but I'm not quite sure. I like this visualization because it tells a story. We can see how little of the plastic is recycled compared to the amount discarded. Out of the small percentage that is discarded, even fewer goes back into actual use while the rest mostly ends up in a landfill. One thing I found confusing that was echoed in the comments is that the majority of the plastic goes directly from production to discarded, which doesn't really make sense. Someone suggests that this represents plastic that was discarded immediately after use, such as fast food containers, but I still think that it would make sense for these to go into the "in use" category first. Other people commented that the animation isn't really needed here and that it could just be a static Sankey diagram. However, I liked the animation because the blue dots help show what happens to the recycled plastic.
