General data visualizations are great, but I'm especially interested in niche visualizations that are only used in limited scenarios. Why isn't an uncommon graph used more often? In this case, I'm referring to the population pyramid. It consists of two opposing vertically oriented bar charts. The result is a shape that can be used to describe populations; how their demographic breakdown looks by age. However, I've never seen visualizations like these outside of the context of population dynamics discussion. 

One reason that these graphs might not be more common is that they seem to be more difficult to read than a typical stacked bar chart. For example, on the linked Russia population pyramid, it can be very difficult to tell the difference between two bands that are similar in length. In the 35-39 age range, it's not clear whether the male or female population is larger. This would be more apparent in a stacked bar chart, where the larger bar would eke out behind the smaller bar. Here, it seems like a preference for population shapes has kept researchers using visualizations that could be suboptimal from a data perception perspective.
