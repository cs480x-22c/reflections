This website builds a visualization of the github account of any user. It uses color and a combination of bar charts and pie charts to communicate the share of repositories written in each language, the amount of stars per repository, and the stars per language used. This is a data exploration tool, as you can enter a new github username into the search field, but there is no way to compare and contrast multiple users at once, which would allow users to get better understanding of their positioning among similar users. On the stars per repo chart, the use of decimals is distracting and causes clutter, but this is an exception to the rest of the page's clean and uncluttered appearance. The addition of the list of repositories at the bottom of the page allows the user to dive in deep and understand more about each datapoint in the chart, if they so choose. This website is a simple and effective way to explore the popular contributions that a GitHub user has made, and to understand what languages they write high quality code in. Through the combination of public data and a small amount of visualization code, the creator of this site made a tool that is useful to a very large number of GitHub users.
