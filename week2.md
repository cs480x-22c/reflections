This is an interesting representation showing when to sell your hype sneakers for the best price. Reselling sneakers is a popular way to make some money with
relatively little effort. This data was provided by StockX, one of the most popular places to sell sneakers online, and the visualization was the winner of StockX's data contest.
It shows based on what region, when you should sell your sneakers and to who. I never realized that where you sell them could have a measurable difference on the money made, but
according to the data it does. This chart shows different chunks of times that indicate when to sell or hold for the best profit. I personally find this interesting because I 
almost always sell within the first time window, which is labeled hold, meaning I must be doing something wrong. I learned a lot from this and it will definitely be helpful in 
the future.
