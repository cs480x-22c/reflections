For my Week 2 reflection I am looking at the data visualized on Biobot's website. 
Biobot is a company that looks at viral particles present in wastewater to predict covid outbreaks. 
The data visualization on this site is a simple color coded line graph.
This is appropriate for the data that is be shown, and the meanning being communicated by it.
The main information that is attempted to be convayed by the chart is the level of covid partilces in the wastewater.
The chart also included the clinical levels of covid observed, likely to prove the validity of their findings as the clinical levels closely track to the wastewater levels.
The chart also provies the ability to compare different regions of the country, convayign this information through the channel of color coded lines.
Although the line graph is a simple and common data visualization technique, the viewer is able to get much more meaning form the graph thatnfrom a table of data.
Viewers can discern the rapid rise of several spikes, if levels are higher than they have been in the past, and how well clinical levels and wastewater levels are related all at a glance.
These less flashy visualizatino techniques are not to be underrated.
