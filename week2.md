This is a interactive visualization that takes the user through 50 years of the Swiss music charts. Each song is seperated into their own
constilation pattern. This gives the visualization an apperance of looking at the stars(might be a pun). Each 'star' or circle has a number on it showing the songs chart progress up to its top ranking.

The songs are aligned left to right displaying the song's mood. The songs on the left being the most sad with the ones on the right being
the most happy.

Additionally there is a scrolling feature that takes you through the years. I found this visualization difficult to read at
times and first had difficulty understanding it. But It was visually appealing enough to keep me engaged till I understood how to read it.
