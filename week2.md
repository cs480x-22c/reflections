This week I found the following visualization from 2018: https://usefulcharts.com/blogs/charts/evolution-of-the-english-alphabet. Created by Matt Baker, it shows the evolution of the modern alphabet starting from the Proto-Sinaitic script (1750 BCE). This visualization is simple and the colors and arrows make it easy to track the evolution of each individual character. I found it interesting to see how some characters disappeared from use and how almost none of the Proto-Sinaitic characters look the same as their counterparts today (except for T). I also observed that some archaic characters look exactly like some modern characters but end up evolving to something else. I think a possible expansion for this visualization would be to include other modern langauges and where they branch off. For example, I imagine that the modern greek alphabet originated from the archaic greek alphabet. The creator of this visualization does link to an updated version. However, I don't think the new one is as effective because it switches between uppercase and lowercase letters. It might be better to show those separately.
