From my politic class terms, I have gained the habbit of being more intune with politic, thus, becoming more analytical of the politcal enviornment more than ever.<br/>
The article used statistic that compared the rate at which inexperienced candidates are winning. <br/>
This is a very clear display of the uptick that the article discussed. <br/>
As this is a more recent pattern with congressional elections, it is closely related to the rise of social media use in politics. <br/>
