Below are two different visualizations of the same data, from r/dataisbeautiful.

Common to both visualizations is how the data is mapped.
In both visualizations, time is mapped to position, and temperature offset is mapped to color.

But the second visualization is harder to read for four reasons.
- The years are not arranged in a line
  - It is somewhat more difficult to locate or look up information about a specific year
  - This is offset by displaying the year numbers on the primitive for each year
- Values for the same month of consecutive years are not near one another
  - It is difficult to compare temperature during any given month from year to year
- Too much whitespace
  - Visualization is too big
  - Harder to see the trend of temperature over time
    - note: temperature offset is continuous with respect to time and the upward slope is the main point, so it is preferable that the trend be easily visible

The second visualization does have advantages, though.
- Inclusion of annual averages as well as monthly
- More visually appealing

Overall, I think the first visualization is a better way to view this data.
