FiveThirtyEight is my new favorite website. For this week's reflection I was browsing through the best and weirdest graphs of 2021. I saw this visualization that is something that I've never seen before. It is a calendar with each date colored differently. This image is seen below. This article was trying to visualize the results of a survey which asked people which day they believed each season starts on. This article can be found here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-very-unscientific-poll-on-when-each-season-starts/ . This survey was conducted out of someone's curiosity and the results are very interesting. Even though it was an informal survey, there were still a lot of responses. There was no real consensus among the responses which surprised me since my immediate thought was that there are actual dates where the season changes and I never questioned that. It turns out that some people associate the changing seasons with events that occur during the months around the change of seasons. 

For example, some people associate the change from winter to spring to be when buds first start to appear on the trees, Easter or Passover, and Saint Patrick's Day. Only 33% of the responses said that the first day of Spring was on the Spring equinox. I really like this article and visualization because not only does the article make a calendar visualization, it shows the data visualized in a more "normal" way as well. The first image below is a "typical" way people show responses to surveys. It is a donut graph with the percent of each response taking up the same percent of the circle. Here, it is easy to visualize how many of the responses lie in each category, but in the second image shown below, the months are layed out calendar style and days are shaded depending on if a response said that they believed a season changed on a specific date. Here, it is easy to see the responses in terms of what other events are going on around the time of the believed season change. It is the use of a calendar, which is something everyone is familiar with, that allows an easily understood and insightful visualization.
