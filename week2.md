This interactive visualization made by Justin Fung shows the estimated population block-by-block in Manhattan.
You can change the time of day and day of the week with the sliders on the bottom of the screen. 
It also enables you to select which districts you would like to view. 
I like how the population values correlate with a color gradient, as well as the height of the bars. 
However, this visualization does have some limitations. It only has data for a typical week in late Spring. 
I think a nice addition to this visualization would be to collect data for the other seasons. 
Then they could allow people to choose which season they want to view, so it can be more relevant to the userâ€™s current date. 
It is also difficult to tell which district is which without toggling them on and off. 
Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this visualization, and it is a good concept for the city that never sleeps.
