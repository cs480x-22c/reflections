The image above contains a graph showing the resting heart rate of individuals throughout 2021. The heart rate of individuals
is indicated using a heat map. Colder colors represent lower resting heart rates. Warmer colors represent higher heart rates.
First I thought it was interesting how the resting heart rate tends to be higher in April. This also happens to be tax month.
I also thought it was odd that the heart rate wasn't lower in the summer. I thought more people would be relaxed. Otherwise other
than April and perhaps June. I don't see any real reason as to why heart rates are up or down. I thought the graph does do a nice
job though in portraying data. Something I learned in Game Design is how to design with affordances in mind. Affordances are key
features of a design that allow the user to immediately know what to do without having to read instructions. This chart clearly has
that quality. Without even looking at the key below I can already tell by the colors when heart rates are up or down.
