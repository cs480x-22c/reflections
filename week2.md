This visualization caught my eye because of how cluttered it appeared when I first looked at it. Upon further investigation, I realized that it actually contains a lot of interesting information. 
However, if I were the one to have published this graph I would have done a few things differently. First off, I would have made the key words stand out more from the word counts, possibly even in a seperate part of the graph. 
I would also have looked at the connection between words over time, or between party members. I did like that political parties were identified by color. I actually think adding another
color legend might have made this graph easier to digest, by posssibly color coding the words based off of topic.
