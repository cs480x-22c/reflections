For my visualization for week 2, I wanted to look at the most commonly used websites on the internet in 2021. I found a visualization on visualcapitalist.com that had this information along with various categories for the websites. It is shown below:

Websites are roughly grouped according to their category. Color in the diagram represents the owning company, which allows the user to see how few overall companies control a large portion of the internet. The color scheme appears to be one of the Tableau color schemes and uses significant contrast between the colors to differentiate the companies.

In addition to this, this visualization is an example of using multiple methods to convey the same data. A bar chart in the top left corner shows the breakdown of websites by category which allows the user to see which kinds of websites are in general the most popular. Various blurbs throughout the diagram also present the user with additional information about the websites. Overall, after a short time looking at this graph a user can get a good sense of which websites are most popular at this time.
