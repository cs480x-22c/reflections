This graph was created by u/JPAnalyst (Reddit) using Excel and the data was sourced from the CDC. They compared the ages of people who died from COVID in 2020 and 2021, creating a line chart for each year. Then, they displayed the % change for each age group between the lines for both years. This visualization was helpful as it clearly displayed how much change occured as the gap may not clearly show the change in deaths. This was done in Excel, so it probably wasn't super complicated to set up, but does a very good job when visualizing simpler datasets like this. Personally, I don't dislike using Excel for plotting, but after using R and ggplot2, I would choose that over Excel. One thing I noticed about R and Excel is that the conditional formatting is very similar for the =IF and ifelse statements. This made it quite easy to understand the formatting for conditions in R.
