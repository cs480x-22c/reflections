This visualization shows plastic waste by country and what percentage is inequality managed. It also shows a correlation with the countries GDP.

By inadequately managed means waste that could end up in waterways and eventually in the ocean. 

We see a lot of countries with 0% inadequately managed waste like the United States, Germany, Japan, and the UK.  China and United States are the countries that generate the most plastic in the world. With China at 59.1m tons per year and the United States at 37.8m tons per year, 74% of Chinaâ€™s 59.1 m tons of plastic waste is inadequately managed. Most of that ends up in the North Pacific Ocean.

 At the bottom of the visualization, the creator used blue whales to measure plastic that ends up in oceans. One Blue Whale =  150,000kg.  There is 642.6 blue whale worth of plastic in the pacific. I think using the Blue Whale as an example for plastic waste gives the viewer a better perspective on how much plastic there is in our oceans.
