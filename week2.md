This visualization is by Jose A. Gras. I was drawn in by the image's colors and contrast. The visualization's artistic touch speaks to the unity of (especially western) Europe in a hopeful way, showing transporation lines within the land. It seems that the lines and connections show ship traffic, air travel and train lines. The powerful part of this image is that country borders cannot be seen at all through all these transportation lines. Even though the image above is a data visualization, it manages to illicit an emotional response.

One change I'd like to see is a legend or key so it is more easy to tell which lines represent which transporation method, although it seems that this visualization's goal was not neccesarily informational but more emotional. To keep the visualization looking like art work, the key may have been ommitted. The color choices and transluscent path lines allowed for a build up. This made the image much more dynamic, and allowed viewers to see the more interconnected parts of Europe by brightness alone. The alpha value of the paths became its own channel of information.
