Reflection 2: Multiple Sequence Alignment of the Taxol Biosynthetic Pathway
===
This week's reflection is regarding something I did recently in my MQP. 

This is a multiple sequence alignment, where I am taking the amino acid sequences produced by several genes of question from <em>Taxus chinensis</em> and comparing them to one another.

This image was produced using the T-Coffee Expresso online tool, which aligns protein sequences using structural information.

The data shows that these proteins have conserved sections in them. TASY is the first enzyme in the Taxol biological pathway, so it's expected for it to be different from the others, hence why it has long strings of amino acids at times while others don't. However, it shows it's similarity to the others in the conserved sites.

All of the intermediate proteins in the pathway have less radical changes in specific places to increase its specificity for its respective catalyst as it makes it way down the pathway.

Shortly after this data was processed, I was talking with my partners and we mentioned that the colors are definitely off, considering how red is good and blue/green is bad. That's unintuitive color choice!

Another unintuitive feature of this image is that it's broken into tiny little strips so that the entire sequence can displayed vertically on a web page, much like a music score, although the way the data is displayed is continuous horizontally. Perhaps a scrollbar could be useful?

Finally, the scores are all relative and don't really say much on their own. There are more effective ways of summarizing this data, at least for our purposes of performing an MSA.
