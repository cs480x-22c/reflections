This data visualization is a chart detailing the "bloody toll" of the war in Iraq, highlighting coalition deaths, the staggering number of civilian deaths, and relevant key events that occurred each month of each year from 2003 to 2011 [1]. In the years spanning this period, the largest number of deaths was 3977 in January 2003 [1] The vis really stuck out to me because of it's vibrant crimson color and downward pointing format; these two simple elements make the chart itself look like a massive bloodstain, establishing very attention-grabbing, appropraite theming given the vis's data and message. At the bottom of the vis, there's also data provided on "the largest killers" of the war's March 19 2008 invasion, with the largest noted cause of deaths being executions followed by/linked with small arms gunfire [1]. If there's anything about this chart that I would critique, it's that the text doesn't scale well with the amount of information on the chart, and that it's difficult to tell exactly which bar coorelates to which month. That having been said, despite these inadequacies, the chart gets its message across comfortably. Overall, I think visualizations like this are important to understanding the gravity of current events and international conflicts. I've always heard about the war in Iraq and known it wasn't anything good, but this chart is the first time I've seen a thoroughly put-together metric regarding the toll's the war in Iraq has taken. That having been said, I was very young when this conflict reached its peak, so it's possible I just didn't see any metrics for that reason. As an additional little side note, this vis holds some significance to me, since my father went oversees for an entire year from 2008 to 2009 to serve in the war against Iraq.
