For week two, I took a look at something a bit more fandom (and less updated), which is this data visualization created by Dave Columbus [(his insta is here)](https://www.instagram.com/dave_columbus/?hl=en). This shows the most important characters generated from a network analysis program and then he used Illustrator to add the graphics. Again this week I focused on media visuals because I think it's some of the most influential data you can work with. The graphic seperates the stages of Doctor Who starting from the 60's and on, seperating Nu/Old Who. I think that something this graphic is missing is a sense of time/way of organizating the data since everything is all over the place. The key on the bottom shows who is the chacter in question being looked at, but not when they are seen outside of the clumping near the large blue dots with numbers in them that repersent the Doctors. If someone was to look at this data, however, and not understand they are looking for a season of a show/specfic Doctor (or that there is so many of the same person?) this graphic makes it harder for general audiences. I also wish there was more information about how Dave gathers his data and what he is sorting (screen time? plot lines?) but overall, this is a fun vis for fans of Doctor Who to look at.
