While this isn't a typical data visualization, per se, it gets the user to a somewhat similar conclusion while offering more interactivity and engagement. I haven't seen many visualizations that are actually interactive beyond perhaps hovering over a point on a line graph to gain an (x, y) readout, whereas here actual questions are provided and answers are expected. Unlike these graphs, which could (for the most part) viewed in print form without losing significant meaning, the question/answer format takes advantage of web technologies. Judge my Music wouldn't be possible without a digital interface, but it takes full advantage of this same digital interface. Perhaps the end result is more of a fun toy/party trick, but it's raised several ideas I'd like to further explore.

First, Judge my Music uses actual users' data; we know that data can be visualized to make compelling arguments, and these visualizations are all the more compelling when the user's information is at stake. What other data can we easily show our users? How can we ensure trust? Second, Judge my Music asks actual questions; while these made me more excited to use the tool, is there any research that recommends when to (and when not to) ask directly? What tradeoffs could this more interactive format involve?
