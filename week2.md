This infographic shows how closely one dog breed is related to others. The data used was the varying DNA between dog breeds. The user can select either a breed of dog or a group to see which breeds are closely related and how closely. When the mouse hovers over one of the lines or dogs, all others are grayed out so the user can focus more easily on one breed. The colored circles around each of the dogs tells us what group they belong to and this can be seen by clicking the drop down labeled “Group Key.” The thickness of the line tells the user how closely the dogs are related and it shows a more exact number when the user places their cursor on the line or dog. This is a useful feature of the chart because the user can easily identify which dog breeds are closest to the one in the middle with a quick scan and then find out more information if they want to. Interestingly, it was found that some dog breeds have no connections with any other breeds such as the Daschund and Grey Wolf. This may be because their genes diverged from other dogs at an earlier point than most other modern day breeds. While this chart may look simple on its face, it offers a ton of information and functionality.
