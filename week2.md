- The visualization shows a colored timeline for different Hollywood movies based on true stories. Each movie's timeline is colored scene by scene a shade of blue or red, indicating the truthfulness of the events depicted. A percentage of truthfulness is shown for each movie. Clicking on a scene a description will appear about what the scene contains and the verified facts of the events portrayed. The user can select how strict to be about what constitutes truth under 3 settings: “Only the absolute truth”, “Can bear some dramatic license” or “Flexible - c’mon, it’s movies!”. There are also filters through which to sort the movies by accuracy, date released or alphabetical order. I chose this visualization, because it has used its tools effectively to make it appealing, fun and informative. As the blue and pink contrast, the false pink scenes stand out. This is effective because this is the main information the user will look for, this allows for the general accuracy of the movie to be conveyed visually at a moment's glance. The user can then also consult the percentage rating to get a more precise and quantitative measure. I also love that the user is given the option to be as strict on flexibility as they wish. Seeing color and percentages slightly adjust as they do. Being able to interact with the timeline to find out what scene it is and also being presented with the reality (including sources to verify the facts) allows the user to learn about what actually happened and allows  them to reach their own conclusions about the movie. Finally, filters allow the user to search for movies effectively, the only thing I wish was added was a search bar. Perhaps this feature was not added because they just don't have a large enough number of movies for it to be worth having a search bar. In conclusion I found this visualization to be expertly made using all the tools at its disposal: color, timelines, interaction and personalization to make it approachable, appealing and informative.
