Week 2 reflection

This week's data is from the following reddit post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/s9rp5f/oc_pokemon_ratings_user_vs_critic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

This graphic is relatively simple. It depicts the ratings of different Pokémon games. On the X-axis, we see the different
years when the games were released. The Y-axis shows the Critic Scores. What's interesting is that this graphic compares 
both the User Scores and the Critic Scores for these games. I liked that they used two different shapes to indicate 
which was the user score (circle) and which was the critic score (diamond). 

I chose this data set because I'm a massive Pokémon fan. I've been playing the games since I was around 6 years old. I was 
interested to see how the different games compared  across the years between users and critics. Also, I'm not sure why the
author chose to omit 6 games that were released between 1996 and 2000. Also , certain games such as Ruby/Sapphire and Diamond/Pearl
had a 3rd release game that was released a year or two later that fixed bugs and changed up the story line a bit and those
aren't reflected here either, even though those games tend to be remarked as the more polished version.

From this graphic, I saw some cool trends. Between the games Hear Gold/ Soul Silver and Black/White, We see a flip in
which score is higher (user vs critic). From the original games' release in 1996 to 2010 (release of Heart Gold/ Soul Silver),
Pokemon games followed a very similar style both visually and game play wise. The game was played in a 2D top down environment
with static sprites. As the years went on, the developers would add animations to moves, but the rest of the sprites were static.
With Black/White, they started using animated sprites and with Black 2/White 2 they improved on them. X/Y was the first game where 
the game was in full 3D instead of the sprites. This had a big impact on the community as a lot of people complained about the new 3D
graphics. This trend would continue for the rest of the games that are getting released. I believe this is whats caused a lot 
of the modern games to lose popularity with users and why we see such low user scores for games that have been released within the last
10 years. 

Overall, this data visualization is pretty simple, but it is surrounding something that I am personally interested in. It 
was cool to see how user impression has gone down overtime, despite the developers working to up the quality of the game.
