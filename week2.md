After Professor Harrison showed some of Peter Beshai's NBA visualizations in class, I was curious to delve further into them as an avid NBA fan. In particular, I found some of his 3D visualizations and decided to explore them. They center around player career totals in things like points, assists, and rebounds.

It is interesting how Beshai uses the added dimension to display further information about data points. He has tools for laying out the data by teams in columns and geographically. There is also a "step" format, where the cylinders are put together in a grid and sorted by value. All of the formats are fascinating to look at, but some are more informative than others. There is a cluster-type format that is very elegant but seems inferior to the grid format in comparing stats across players. There are also formats to divide players by teams in a grid, but I feel that the geographical layout is a lot more intuitive. It is much easier to find a team by looking for their home city than by searching through a grid sorted in alphabetical order.

Additionally, I feel that Beshai could have made some use of color instead of having all the cylinders be gray. Perhaps there could have been some toggle-able feature that would enable a color scale based on a player's height, seasons played, or time period in which they played. 

Overall, I found it fascinating to explore a 3D visualization. It helps provide an extra sense of scale to the data, and really makes me appreciate the statistical outliers more.
