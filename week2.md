Visualization: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/interactive-budget

For this week’s visualization we are going back 8 years (I can’t believe it’s been 8 years) to Obama’s Presidency. This visualization allows the user to interact with the proposed budget for 2016 to see how their tax dollars are being used. 

Off the bat I think this is a cool idea. Breaks it down nice and easily for those who don’t know much about the white house budget. The data is broken down into different categories such as health care, social security, national defense, etc. The categories are in the shape of rectangles and each rectangle is proportionally sized to how much of the budget is used for that category. Also, each category is a different color. 

Within each broad category listed there are subcategories. For example, under health care there is Medicare, health research and food safety, Medicaid and children’s health insurance, and other health care. When healthcare is clicked on the website, it zooms into these subgroups. Also, these subgroups are different shaded of the original category. So, health is red, all the subcategories are different shades of red. 

When a subcategory is clicked, it zooms into a little description given and a link to more information. When any parent or child category is hovered over, the value of the budget designated to them is listed. 

I would say this data is more expository because it is trying to explain to others the break down of the 2016 budget proposal. 

Here’s what I liked about the Data Vis:
-	It is very easy to use 
-	Provides enough information without cluttering the pages while providing links to more resources

Here’s some of the downfalls I saw: 
-	Looks wise, its not the prettiest thing to look at.
- I wish they used a different color palette or shade of the colors 
- I also think that the rectangles were a good idea, but because of the size of the text and how small some of these categories get respectively, the text goes over some     rectangles and it all becomes a little congested and hard to read. 

A suggestion could maybe be using a numbered key or legend for the smaller areas. Or maybe using a layered pyramid for the parent categories because that would still show the general progression of where the budget is allocated.
