This visualization represents the population density in europe. The areas where in the map where it looks more crowded with the larger bar heights represents the areas with high population density. Instead of using a simple 2D map with highlighted areas, this 3D map provides a more creative design element as it provides an extremely aesthetic data map while providing the main functionality of effectively displaying the most population dense locations in Europe. The author that created this visualization stated that this map was created to allow the audience to understand the patterns in the data but to also provide us with a eye-catching visualization. He also stated this visualization was meant to be more experimental and aesthetic than simple just analytical.

It was also very interesting that the author of this map tried creating different perspectives of the data. Difference density locations can appear a little different in each perspective. So including all the different perspectives can allow the audience to grasp the true trends of the information.

I think visualizations like these will be very vital and important, especially in the coming future. This is because, in presentations, visualizations like these 3D maps will allow the audience to be drawn to the aesthetic of the map which may lead the audience to grasp the concept and trends in the data more easily. Many times, when data visualizations don't interactively and aesthetically prove the point in the data, the main ideas don't stick in the audience's mind.
