With everything going on with the Coronavirus pandemic, for this week's data visualization example I found online consists of a cholera outbreak map in 1854. Created by John Snow, yes John Snow, and no not the Game of Thrones guy. This data visualization can be referred to as an early dot map visualization. It consists of bar graphs overalyed on city blocks. It was designed so that the density of the bars as well as the location of the bars may reveal any insight as to what the underlying causes may have been for these outbreaks. As it turns out, the area with the highest concentration of cholera cases, residents were all drinking out of the same well water. It was later found that this well water was contaminated with sewage. The solution then was to build entirely seperate sewage systems so there is no cross contamination. I thought it was very cool that such a primitive data form as some bars on a graph could help viewers clearly identify an issue and then come to a solution. Though this isn't some new form of data visualization, I thought it was interesting to see an early form data overlays on maps. In the current coronavirus pandemic, these heat maps pertaining to COVID cases can be found all over the internet. Finally this form of data representation was way before its time and was an incredible push on the boundaries of visualization.
