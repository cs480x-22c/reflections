This week's visualization: https://everynoise.com/engenremap.html

I decided I wanted to find something I was more interested in this week, and went looking into animals and music. While looking around, I found the everynoise genre map! This website shows a map of every genre of music spread across a sheet. If you press a specific genre of music, a sample of a sound from that genre will play. Then, if you go to a specific arrow, it will go to a map of a bunch of the different artists who fall under that genre. Then, if you press the artist, a song will play and then if you press that arrow it will go to the artist on spotify! There's also an option to look at it in a list format and if you press a specific genre a playlist with songs of that genre will appear on the side and similar genres will follow below. 
I thought this was super cool. While not necessarily super visually appealing, it has a lot of cool abilities and is awesome for anyone who wants to find a new music genre and discover new artists and songs. The fact that it goes to spotify too is very interesting, although if people don't have spotify then they won't be able to use the feature. It also has the nice feature of if you have played the noise for a specific genre a little music note will come up so you are aware of what you've played. The only setback is if you press the arrow to the artists, and then go back to the main genre screen you will no longer have the music notes saved. 

I thought this was very interesting and displayed a good use of linking to different things and inserting music into a visualization, which is pretty neat. Again, it could have been more aesthetically pleasing but the features itself were very cool.
