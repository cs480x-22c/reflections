This data visualization is a chart detailing the "bloody toll" of the war in Iraq, highlighting coalition deaths, the much larger number of civilian deaths, and different key events that occurred each year from 2003 to 2011 [1]. The vis really stuck out to me because of it's vibrant crimson color and downward pointing format. These two simple elements make the chart itself look like a massive bloodstain, establishing very appropraite theming given the vis's data and message. The vis also holds some significance to me, since my father went oversees for an entire year from 2008 to 2009 to server in the war against Iraq.
