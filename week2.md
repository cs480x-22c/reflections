This data visualization uses a stacked area chart to show popular baby names in the US from 1880 to 2020. I think this is a concise way to show many different names at the same time. Rather than having multiple charts to look at for each name you can have one large one with all of them. This allows for easy comparison between the number of babies with each of the names, especially if two names have a close amount of babies with that name. For example, the number of babies with the names Helen and Patricia are very close in the 1910s-1920s, but there were slightly more babies with the name Patricia. You wouldn't be able to notice this difference if the two names were on different charts especially at the large scale that this graph is. Also, an area chart is better than a line chart when you are stacking then on top of each other. If multiple line were stacked on top of each other, the chart would look too busy and it would be hard to differentiate the lines. There are many advantages to using a stacked area chart, but there are also some disadvantages. It is harder to evaluate a single name since an area chart might be cut off by the overlapping area charts. For example, if there were a low number of babies with a certain name that name wouldn't even show up on the stacked area chart because all the other names would cover it. It would also be too distracting to try and evaluate one name when all the other names are surrounding it.
