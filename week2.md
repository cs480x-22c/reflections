<h1> Reflection 2: Wordle Decision Tree</h1>

For this week's reflection, I decided to a little digging to find a visualization about a new online word game, Wordle. Wordle is a daily word guessing game that allows the player to input 5 letter words each line, with each guess telling you if your letter is in the correct space of the word, if it is in the word but in the wrong space, or if the letter is not in the word. 

Owner of the data visualization collectiong Raw Data Studies, @xianregg, took on the challenge of creating a decision tree based around the possible solutions to Wordle challenges in order to find out statistics such as the best or worst word to start with, and the average amount of guesses required to guess correctly.

Xianregg created this visualization to deisplay the decision tree's output:

<h2> Refection </h2>

The graph is a little difficult to read, but accompanied by the report on RawDataStudies, the visual actually answers all the things that the author was looking for. To read the graph, each circle starting from the middle is a guess with each cut in the ring being a different word guess.

As Xianregg used multiple first words to begin the decision tree (other words being on the report), the density of each visualization shows that, no matter the beginning word, almost every word will lead to the same amount of guesses being made to get the correct answer. The amount of rings shown on the visualization also displays ledgable information, particularly the amount of guesses needed to correctly guess any word. The high density of green squares (Correct letter & Correct space) on the 4th and 5th ring shows that it takes about 5 guesses to win. 

The graph itself seems like a mess, with random colors, lengths, and varying ring amounts scattered around the beginning guess. At first, I thought that the graph was pretty bad, as the basic idea of what the visual was for was pretty easy to ascertain. However, the well crafted report makes the visual very nice, and suprisingly insightful.
